Junk-bond
markdowns
,
an
ongoing
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
investigation
,
a
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
connection
,
a
fizzled
buy-out
rumor
.

All
this
has
cast
a
pall
over
Columbia
Savings
&
Loan
Association
and
its
high-rolling
43-year-old
chairman
,
Thomas
Spiegel
,
who
built
the
$
12.7
billion
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif.
,
thrift
with
high-yield
junk
bonds
.

Bears
have
targeted
Columbia
's
stock
because
of
the
thrift
's
exposure
to
the
shaky
junk
market
.

And
some
investors
fault
Mr.
Spiegel
's
life
style
;
he
earns
millions
of
dollars

a
year
and
flies
around
in
Columbia
's
jet
planes
.

Columbia
stock
recently
hit
4
,
after
reaching
11
earlier
this
year
on
rumors
that
Mr.
Spiegel
would
take
the
thrift
private
.

Moreover
,
junk
professionals
think
Columbia
's
huge
third-quarter
markdown
of
its
junk
portfolio
to
$
4.4
billion
was
n't
enough
,
meaning
another
markdown
could
be
coming
.

But
in
recent
days
,
Columbia
has
edged
up
,
closing
at
5
,
up
,
yesterday
on
revived
speculation
that
the
thrift
might
restructure
.

Mr.
Spiegel
's
fans
say
Columbia
's
Southern
California
branches
are
highly
salable
,
and
the
thrift
has
$
458
million
of
shareholders
equity
underlying
its
assets
.

That
's
almost
$
10
of
equity
for
each
Columbia
share
,
including
convertible
preferred
shares
,
though
more
junk
markdowns
would
reduce
the
cushion
.

Columbia
has
only
about
10
million
common
shares
in
public
hands
.

The
Spiegel
family
has
25
%
of
the
common
and
75
%
of
the
votes
.

Other
big
common
holders
are
Carl
Lindner
's
American
Financial
,
investor
Irwin
Jacobs
and
Pacific
Financial
Research
,
though
the
latter
cut
its
stake

this
summer
.

While
many
problems
would
attend
a
restructuring
of
Columbia
,
investors
say
Mr.
Spiegel
is
mulling
such
a
plan
to
mitigate
Columbia
's
junk
problems
.

Indeed
,
Columbia
executives
recently
told
reporters
they
were
interested
in
creating
a
separate
unit
to
hold
Columbia
's
junk
bonds
and
perhaps
do
merchant
banking
.

Columbia
wo
n't
comment
on
all
the
speculation
.

But
like
other
thrifts
,
it
's
expected
to
seek
regulators
'
consent
to
create
a
distinct
junk-bond
entity
.

Plans
to
do
this
are
due
to
be
filed
in
a
week
or
so
.

New
rules
force
thrifts
to
write
down
their
junk
to
market
value
,
then
sell
the
bonds
over
five
years
.

That
's
why
Columbia
just
wrote
off
$
130
million
of
its
junk
and
reserved
$
227
million
for
future
junk
losses
.

But
if
Columbia
could
keep
its
junk
bonds
separate
from
the
thrift
till
they
mature
--
at
full
value
,
unless
the
issuer
goes
bust
or
restructures
--
the
junk
portfolio
might
do
all
right
.

Columbia
,
a
longtime
Drexel
client
,
wo
n't
provide
current
data
on
its
junk
.

But
its
17
big
junk
holdings
at
year
end
showed
only
a
few
bonds

that
have
been
really
battered
.

These
were
Allied
Stores
,
Western
Union
Telegraph
,
Gillett
Holdings
,
SCI
Television
and
Texas
Air
,
though
many
other
bonds
in
Columbia
's
portfolio
also
have
lost
value
.

Possibly
offsetting
that
,
Columbia
recently
estimated
it
has
unrealized
gains
on
publicly
traded
equity
investments
of
more
than
$
70
million
.

It
also
hopes
for
ultimate
gains
of
as
much
as
$
300
million
on
equity
investments
in
buy-outs
and
restructurings
.

One
trial
balloon
Mr.
Spiegel
is
said
to
have
floated
to
investors
:
Columbia
might
be
broken
up
,
as
Mellon
Bank
was
split
into
a
good
bank
and
a
bad
bank
.

But
Columbia
's
good
bank
would
be
a
regulated
thrift
,
while
the
bad
bank
would
be
a
private
investment
company
,
holding
some
of
Columbia
's
junk
bonds
,
real
estate
and
equity
investments
.

Some
think
Columbia
's
thrift
,
which
now
is
seeking
a
new
chief
operating
officer
,
might
be
capitalized
at
,
say
$
300
million
,
and
shopped
to
a
commercial
bank

that
wants
a
California
presence
.

The
thrift
surely
could
be
sold
for
more
than
the
value
of
its
equity
,
financial
industry
executives
say
.

Meanwhile
,
the
bad
bank
with
the
junk
bonds
--
and
some
capital
--
might
be
spun
off
to
Columbia
shareholders
,
including
Mr.
Spiegel
,
who
might
then
have
a
new
career
,
investors
say
.

It
is
n't
clear
how
much
a
restructuring
would
help
Columbia
stockholders
.

But
``
the
concept
is
workable
.

You
sell
the
good
bank
as
an
ongoing
operation
and
use
some
of
the
proceeds
to
capitalize
the
bad
bank
,
''
says
thrift
specialist
Lewis
Ranieri
of
Ranieri
Associates
in
New
York
.

Mr.
Spiegel
's
next
career
move
is
a
subject
of
speculation
on
Wall
Street
.

Few
people
think
Mr.
Spiegel
wants
to
run
a
bread-and-butter
thrift
,
which

current
rules
would
force
Columbia
to
become
.

``
They
are
n't
really
a
thrift
,
''
says
Jonathan
Gray
,
a
Sanford
C.
Bernstein
analyst
.

Of
course
,
regulators
would
have
to
approve
Columbia
's
reorganization
.

And
some
investment
bankers
say
a
restructuring
is
n't
feasible
while
the
SEC
still
is
scrutinizing
Mr.
Spiegel
's
past
junk-bond
trades
.

The
Finnish
government
and
major
creditors
of
bankrupt
shipyard
Waertsilae
Marine
Industries
Oy
agreed
in
principle
to
form
a
new
company
to
complete
most
of
the
troubled
shipyard
's
backlog
of
15
ships
.

The
new
company
will
attempt
to
limit
the
shipyard
's
losses
,
participants
said
.

``
The
situation
is
that
the
bankruptcy
court
will
get
out
of
the
shipbuilding
business
.

Everything
will
be
taken
over
by
the
new
company
,
''
said
Christian
Andersson
,
executive
vice
president
of
Oy
Waertsilae
,
former
parent
of
Waertsilae
Marine
.

Once
its
ownership
is
finalized
,
the
new
company
will
open
talks
with
state-appointed
receivers
to
buy
or
lease
Waertsilae
Marine
's
shipyard
facilities
.

Subcontractors
will
be
offered
a
settlement
and
a
swift
transition
to
new
management
is
expected
to
avert
an
exodus
of
skilled
workers
from
Waertsilae
Marine
's
two
big
shipyards
,
government
officials
said
.

Under
an
accord
signed
yesterday
,
the
government
and
Union
Bank
of
Finland
would
become
major
shareholders
in
the
new
company
,
each
injecting
100
million
Finnish
markkaa
(
$
23.5
million
)
.

Oy
Waertsilae
is
to
contribute
200
million
markkaa
,
most
of
it
as
subordinated
debt
,
and
take
a
minority
stake
in
the
new
company
.

Customers
holding
contracts
for
Waertsilae
Marine
's
undelivered
ships
are
expected
to
subscribe
most
of
the
remaining
170
million
markkaa
in
share
capital
,
government
officials
said
.

Waertsilae
Marine
's
biggest
creditor
is
Miami-based
Carnival
Cruise
Lines
Inc
.

Carnival
,
which
has
three
ships
on
order
from
Waertsilae
Marine
,
presented
claims
for
$
1.5
billion
damages
in
the
bankruptcy
court

this
week
.

Waertsilae
Marine
's
bankruptcy
proceedings
began
Tuesday
in
a
Helsinki
court
.

Tokyo
stocks
edged
up
Wednesday
in
relatively
active
but
unfocused
trading
.

London
shares
finished
moderately
higher
.

At
Tokyo
,
the
Nikkei
index
of
225
selected
issues
,
which
gained
132
points
Tuesday
,
added
14.99
points
to
35564.43
.

In
early
trading
in
Tokyo
Thursday
,
the
Nikkei
index
fell
63.79
points
to
35500.64
.

Wednesday
's
volume
on
the
First
Section
was
estimated
at
900
million
shares
,
in
line
with
Tuesday
's
909
million
.

Declining
issues
slightly
outnumbered
advancing
issues
,
454
to
451
.

Investors
switched
trading
focus
quickly
as
they
did
Tuesday
,
reflecting
uncertainty
about
long-term
commitments
to
any
issue
or
sector
,
traders
said
.

Speculation
,
on
the
other
hand
,
sparked
buying
in
certain
incentive-backed
issues
,
though
rumors
underlying
such
shares
eventually
proved
untrue
.

The
development
,
traders
said
,
showed
that
there
is
more
than
ample
liquidity
available
for
investment
despite
the
market
's
recent
directionless
trend
.

Dealers
led
the
market
Wednesday
by
actively
trading
for
their
own
accounts
,
observers
said
.

Institutions
mostly
remained
on
the
sidelines
because
of
uncertainty
regarding
interest
rates
and
the
dollar
.

The
Tokyo
Stock
Price
Index
(
Topix
)
of
all
issues
listed
in
the
First
Section
,
which
gained
16.05
points
Tuesday
,
was
down
1.46
points
,
or
0.05
%
,
at
2691.19
.

The
Second
Section
index
,
which
added
6.84
points
Tuesday
,
was
up
5.92
points
,
or
0.16
%
,
to
close
at
3648.82
.

Volume
in
the
second
section
was
estimated
at
18
million
shares
,
up
from
14
million
Tuesday
.

Akio
Yamamoto
,
managing
director
of
Nomura
Investment
Trust
Management
,
said
that
if
the
U.S.
federal
funds
rate
declines
to
around
8.5
%
,
institutions
would
acquire
a
clearer
idea
regarding
the
direction
of
the
market
and
thus
more
comfortably
participate
in
active
buying
.

Tokyu
Group
,
Mitsubishi
Estate
and
,
which
advanced
Tuesday
,
declined
on
profit-taking
.

Wednesday
's
dominant
issue
was
Yasuda
Fire
&
Marine
Insurance
,
which
continued
to
surge
on
rumors
of
speculative
buying
.

It
ended
the
day
up
80
yen
(
56
cents
)
to
1,880
yen
(
$
13.15
)
.

Due
to
continuingly
high
gold
prices
tied
to
uncertainty
about
the
U.S.
currency
,
investor
interest
was
directed
toward
oil
and
mining
shares
,
which
traders
called
a
``
defensive
''
action
frequently
taken
when
the
dollar
is
expected
to
fall
or
during
times
of
inflation
.

Teikoku
Oil
,
also
stimulated
by
rumors
of
speculative
buying
,
advanced
100
yen
to
1,460
.

Showa
Shell
gained
20
to
1,570
and
Mitsubishi
Oil
rose
50
to
1,500
.

Sumitomo
Metal
Mining
fell
five
yen
to
692
and
Nippon
Mining
added
15
to
960
.

Among
other
winners
Wednesday
was
Nippon
Shokubai
,
which
was
up
80
at
2,410
.

Marubeni
advanced
11
to
890
.

London
share
prices
were
bolstered
largely
by
continued
gains
on
Wall
Street
and
technical
factors
affecting
demand
for
London
's
blue-chip
stocks
.

The
Financial
Times-Stock
Exchange
100-share
index
closed
17.5
points
higher
at
2160.1
.

It
rose
largely
throughout
the
session
after
posting
an
intraday
low
of
2141.7
in
the
first
40
minutes
of
trading
.

The
index
ended
the
day
near
its
session
high
of
2163.2
,
which
was
posted
within
the
last
half-hour
of
trading
.

Dealers
said
most
investor
interest
was
focused
on
defensive
blue-chip
stocks
,
particularly
those
with
limited
U.K.
exposure
.

Also
,
several
key
blue
chips
were
pushed
higher
in
thin
volume
because
of
a
technical
squeeze
among
market
makers
.

Sterling
's
firm
tone
,
combined
with
a
steady
opening
on
Wall
Street
,
also
tempted
some
investors
to
come
back
to
the
market
,
dealers
said
.

There
were
concerns
early
in
the
day
that
Wall
Street
's
sharp
gains
on
Tuesday
were
overdone
and
due
for
a
reversal
.

The
FT
30-share
index
settled
16.7
points
higher
at
1738.1
.

Volume
was
372.9
million
shares
,
up
from
334.5
million
on
Tuesday
.

Dealers
said
institutions
were
still
largely
hugging
the
sidelines
on
fears
that
the
market
's
recent
technical
rally
might
prove
fragile
.

They
cited
Wall
Street
's
recent
volatility
and
the
lack
of
a
clear
indication
over
the
market
's
short-term
direction
as
factors
in
the
institutional
caution
.

Jaguar
,
a
U.K.
luxury
auto
maker
being
pursued
by
Ford
Motor
and
General
Motors
,
gained
10
pence
(
16
cents
)
a
share
to
close
at
879
pence
(
$
13.90
)
.

It
shed
about
7
pence
,
however
,
after
dealers
said
the
market
was
disappointed
that
Ford
did
n't
move
to
tender
a
bid
for
control
of
the
company
.

Dealers
said
the
U.K.
government
's
decision
Tuesday
to
waive
its
protective
``
golden
share
''
in
the
auto
maker
raised
prospects
of
a
bidding
war
between
the
two
U.S.
auto
giants
.

But
the
waiver
also
was
seen
as
a
signal
that
Ford
,
a
major
U.K.
auto
industry
employer
,
was
able
to
gain
government
acceptance
of
its
bid
for
control
of
Jaguar
.

Dealers
said
that
interpretation
sparked
expectations
of
an
imminent
bid
by
Ford
.

B.A.T
Industries
,
which
is
being
pursued
by
Sir
James
Goldsmith
's
Hoylake
Investments
,
rose
9
to
753
on
speculation
that
Hoylake
will
sweeten
its
bid
,
dealers
said
.

Like
Jaguar
,
B.A.T
also
eased
off
its
highs
in
afternoon
dealings
.

Reed
International
,
a
U.K.
publishing
group
,
gained
15
to
397
despite
reporting
a
3.7
%
drop
in
interim
pretax
profit
.

Analysts
said
the
fall
in
pretax
profit
was
due
to
the
group
's
recent
restructuring
and
sale
of
peripheral
units
,
and
that
its
remaining
businesses
are
performing
well
.

Dealers
said
the
market
agreed
.

Stocks
boosted
by
market-makers
shopping
to
cover
book
requirements
in
FT-SE
100
shares
included
Carlton
Communications
,
which
climbed
32
to
778
.

Drug
companies
in
the
key
index
also
notched
gains
as
market-makers
searched
for
stock
in
anticipation
of
demand
due
to
the
sector
's
defensive
qualities
.

Wellcome
gained
18
to
666
on
a
modest
1.1
million
shares
.

Glaxo
,
the
U.K.
's
largest
pharmaceutical
concern
,
advanced
23
to

Elsewhere

To
make
them
directly
comparable
,
each

equaling

The

Allergan
Inc.
said
it
received
Food
and
Drug
Administration
approval
to
sell
the
PhacoFlex
intraocular
lens
,
the
first
foldable
silicone
lens
available
for
cataract
surgery
.

The
len
's
foldability
enables
it
to
be
inserted
in
smaller
incisions
than
are
now
possible
for
cataract
surgery
,
the
eye
care
and
skin
care
concern
said
.

Cataracts
refer
to
a
clouding
of
the

Allergan
was

as
part
of
the
merger
of
SmithKline
and
Beecham

Group

Genetics
Institute
Inc.
,
Cambridge
,
Mass.
,
said
it
was
awarded
U.S.
patents
for
Interleukin-3
and
bone
morphogenetic
protein
.

The
patent
for
Interleukin-3
covers
materials
and
methods
used
to
make
the
human
blood
cell
growth
factor
via
recombinant
DNA
technology
.

Sandoz
Ltd.
has
licensed
certain
manufacturing
and
marketing
rights
for
Interleukin-3
from
Genetics
Institute
and
is
conducting
preclinical
studies
with
it
.

Interleukin-3
may
help
in
treating
blood
cell
deficiencies
associated
with
cancer
treatment
,
bone
marrow
transplants
and
other
blood-cell
disorders
,
Genetics
Institute
said
.

The
second
patent
describes
bone
morphogenetic
protein-1
,
a
substance

that
can
induce
formation
of
new
cartilage
.

The
patent
covers
BMP-1
type
proteins
and
pharmaceutical
compositions
and
methods
for
treating
bone
or
cartilage
defects
,
Genetics
Institute
said
.

The
company
added
that
it
has
filed
patent
applications
``
on
a
large
number
of
different
BMP
proteins
''
and
the
patent
on
BMP-1
is
the
first
it
has
received
.

BMP
products
may
be
useful
in
fracture
healing
and
in
treating
bone
loss
associated
with
periodontal
disease
and
certain
cancers
,
the
company
said
.

A
House-Senate
conference
approved
major
portions
of
a
package
for
more
than
$
500
million
in
economic
aid
for
Poland

that
relies
heavily
on
$
240
million
in
credit
and
loan
guarantees
in
fiscal
1990
in
hopes
of
stimulating
future
trade
and
investment
.

For
the
Agency
for
International
Development
,
appropriators
approved
$
200
million
in
secondary
loan
guarantees
under
an
expanded
trade
credit
insurance
program
,
and
total
loan
guarantees
for
the
Overseas
Private
Investment
Corp.
are
increased
by
$
40
million
over
fiscal
1989
as
part
of
the
same
Poland
package
.

The
conference
approved
at
least
$
55
million
in
direct
cash
and
development
assistance
as
well
,
and
though
no
decision
was
made
,
both

sides
are
committed
to
adding
more
than
$
200
million
in
economic
support
funds
and
environmental
initiatives
sought
by
the
Bush
administration
.

The
agreement
on
Poland
contrasts
with
the
major
differences
remaining
over
the
underlying
foreign
aid
bill
,
which
has
already
provoked
veto
threats
by
the
White
House
and
is
sharply
confined
under
this
year
's
budget
.

These
fiscal
pressures
are
also
a
factor
in
shaping
the
Poland
package
,
and
while
more
ambitious
authorizing
legislation
is
still
pending
,
the
appropriations
bill
in
conference
will
be
more
decisive
on
U.S.
aid
to
Eastern
Europe
.

To
accommodate
the
additional
cash
assistance
,
the
House
Appropriations
Committee
last
week
was
required
to
reallocate
an
estimated
$
140
million
from
the
Pentagon
.

And
though
the
size
of
the
loan
guarantees
approved
yesterday
is
significant
,
recent
experience
with
a
similar
program
in
Central
America
indicates
that
it
could
take
several
years
before
the
new
Polish
government
can
fully
use
the
aid
effectively
.

The
action
on
Poland
came
as
the
conference
separately
approved
$
220
million
for
international
population
planning
activities
,
an
11
%
increase
over
fiscal
1989
.

The
House
and
Senate
are
divided
over
whether
the
United
Nations
Population
Fund
will
receive
any
portion
of
these
appropriations
,
but
the
size
of
the
increase
is
itself
significant
.

In
a
second
area
of
common
concern
,
the
world
environment
,
an
additional
$
15
million
will
be
provided
in
development
assistance
to
fund
a
series
of
initiatives
,
related
both
to
global
warming
and
the
plight
of
the
African
elephant
.

The
sweeping
nature
of
the
bill
draws
a
variety
of
special
interest
amendments
,
running
from
an
import
exemption
for
a
California
airplane
museum
to
a
small
but
intriguing
struggle
among
sugar
producing
nations
over
the
fate
of
Panama
's
quota
of
exports
to
the
profitable
U.S.
market
.

Panama
was
stripped
of
this
right
because
of
U.S.
differences
with
the
Noriega
regime
,
but
the
Central
American
country
would
have
received
a
quota
of
30,537
metric
tons
over
a
21-month
period
ending
Sept.
30
,
1990
.

About
a
quarter
of
this
share
has
already
been
reallocated
,
according
to
the
industry
,
but
the
remaining
23,403
tons
are
still
a
lucrative
target
for
growers
because
the
current
U.S.
price
of
18
cents

a
pound
runs
as
much
as
a
nickel

a
pound
above
the
world
rate
.

The
potential
sales
are
nearly
$
9.3
million
,
and
House
Majority
Whip
William
Gray
(
D.
,
Pa
.

)
began
the
bidding

this
year
by
proposing
language
that
the
quota
be
allocated
to
English-speaking
countries
of
the
Caribbean
,
such
as
Jamaica
and
Barbados
.

Rep.
Jerry
Lewis
,
a
conservative
Californian
,
added
a
provision
of
his
own
intended
to
assist
Bolivia
,
and
the
Senate
then
broadened
the
list
further
by
including
all
countries
in
the
U.S.
Caribbean
Basin
initiate
as
well
as
the
Philippines
-
backed
by
the
powerful
Hawaii
Democrat
Sen.
Daniel
Inouye
.

Jamaica
,
wary
of
upsetting
its
Caribbean
Basin
allies
,
has
apparently
instructed
its
lobbyist
to
abandon
the
provision
initially
drafted
by
Mr.
Gray
,
but
the
greater
question
is
whether
Mr.
Inouye
,
who
has
strong
ties
to
the
sugar
industry
,
is
able
to
insert
a
claim
by
the
Philippines
.

In
separate
floor
action
,
the
House
waived
budget
restrictions
and
gave
quick
approval
to
$
3.18
billion
in
supplemental
appropriations
for
law
enforcement
and
anti-drug
programs
in
fiscal
1990
.

The
funding
is
attached
to
an
estimated
$
27.1
billion
transportation
bill

that
goes
next
to
the
Senate
and
carries
with
it

a
proposed
permanent
smoking
ban
on
virtually
all
U.S.
domestic
airline
flights
.

The
leadership
hopes
to
move
the
compromise
measure
promptly
to
the
White
House
,
but
in
recent
days
,
the
Senate
has
been
as
likely
to
bounce
bills
back
to
the
House
.

The
most
recent
example
was
a
nearly
$
17.3
billion
fiscal
1990
bill
funding
the
State
,
Justice
and
Commerce
departments
.

And
after
losing
a
battle
Tuesday
night
with
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
,
appropriators
from
both

houses
are
expected
to
be
forced
back
to
conference
.

GenCorp
Inc.
,
hurt
by
a
plant
accident
and
other
unexpected
costs
,
said
it
expects
to
report
that
fiscal
fourth-quarter
profit
from
continuing
operations
will
be
significantly
below
last
year
's
$
25
million
.

The
Fairlawn
,
Ohio-based
company
also
said
that
full-year
profit
from
continuing
operations
will
be
far
below
last
year
's
$
148
million
.

Last
year
's
figures
include
a
one-time
loss
of
$
12
million
for
restructuring
and
unusual
items
.

But
the
automotive
parts
and
aerospace
concern
expects
that
net
for
the
year
ending
Nov.
30
will
exceed
last
fiscal
year
's
net
of
$
70
million
,
or
$
2.19

a
share
,
primarily
because
of
$
200
million
in
gains
from
sales
of
discontinued
operations
.

Harry
Millis
,
an
analyst
at
McDonald
&
Co.
in
Cleveland
,
said
GenCorp
's
unanticipated
losses
come
largely
from
an
accident
at
a
government-owned
assembly
plant
in
Kansas
,
run
by
a
private
subcontractor
,
that
makes
cluster
bombs
for
GenCorp
's
Aerojet
Ordnance
business
.

Transamerica
Corp.
,
San
Francisco
,
said
third-quarter
profit
was
essentially
flat
despite
a
large
one-time
gain
a
year
earlier
.

The
insurance
and
financial
services
concern
said
profit
for
the
quarter
rose
1.1
%
to
$
93.9
million
,
or
$
1.19

a
share
,
compared
with
$
92.9
million
,
or
$
1.18

a
share
,
the
year
earlier
.

The
results
reflected
a
24
%
gain
in
income
from
its
finance
businesses
,
and
a
15
%
slide
in
income
from
insurance
operations
.

Transamerica
said
third-quarter
investment
gains
were
$
10.2
million
,
compared
with
$
6.4
million

the
year
earlier
.

It
said
insurance
profit
reflected
a
$
6
million
loss
from
Hurricane
Hugo
.

It
also
estimated
that
losses
from
the
Oct.
17
earthquake
in
California
would
be
no
more
than
$
6
million
,
and
would
be
included
in
fourth-quarter
results
.

Reed
International
PLC
said
that
net
income
for
the
six
months
ended
Oct.
1
slipped
5
%
to
#
89.7
million
(
$
141.9
million
)
,
or
16
pence

a
share
,
from
#
94.8
million
(
$
149.9
million
)
,
or
17.3
pence

a
share
.

The
British
paper
,
packaging
and
publishing
concern
,
said
profit
from
continuing
lines
fell
10
%
to
#
118
million
from
#
130.6
million
.

While
there
were
no
one-time
gains
or
losses
in
the
latest
period
,
there
was
a
one-time
gain
of
#
18
million
in
the
1988
period
.

And
while
there
was
no
profit

this
year
from
discontinued
operations
,
last
year

they
contributed
#
34
million
,
before
tax
.

Pretax
profit
fell
3.7
%
to
#
128
million
from
#
133
million
and
was
below
analysts
'
expectations
of
#
130
million
to
#
135
million
,
but
shares
rose
6
pence
to
388
pence
in
early
trading
yesterday
in
London
.

Reed
is
paying
an
interim
dividend
of
4.6
pence
,
up
15
%
from
4
pence

a
year
earlier
.

Sales
fell
20
%
to
#
722
million
.

Earnings
were
hurt
by
disposal
of
operations
in
its
restructuring
,
Reed
said
.

In
the
aftermath
of
the
stock
market
's
gut-wrenching
190-point
drop
on
Oct.
13
,
Kidder
,
Peabody
&
Co.
's
1,400
stockbrokers
across
the
country
began
a
telephone
and
letter-writing
campaign
aimed
at
quashing
the
country
's
second-largest
program
trader
.

The
target
of
their
wrath
?

Their
own
employer
,
Kidder
Peabody
.

Since
October
's
minicrash
,
Wall
Street
has
been
shaken
by
an
explosion
of
resentment
against
program
trading
,
the
computer-driven
,
lightning-fast
trades
of
huge
baskets
of
stocks
and
futures

that
can
send
stock
prices
reeling
in
minutes
.

But
the
heated
fight
over
program
trading
is
about
much
more
than
a
volatile
stock
market
.

The
real
battle
is
over
who
will
control
that
market
and
reap
its
huge
rewards
.

Program
trading
itself
,
according
to
many
academics

who
have
studied
it
,
is
merely
caught
in
the
middle
of
this
battle
,
unfairly
labeled
as
the
evil
driving
force
of
the
marketplace
.

The
evidence
indicates
that
program
trading
did
n't
,
in
fact
,
cause
the
market
's
sharp
fall
on
Oct.
13
,
though
it
may
have
exacerbated
it
.

On
one
side
of
this
power
struggle
stand
the
forces
in
ascendency
on
Wall
Street
--
the
New
Guard
--
consisting
of
high-tech
computer
wizards
at
the
major
brokerage
firms
,
their
pension
fund
clients
with
immense
pools
of
money
,
and
the
traders
at
the
fast-growing
Chicago
futures
exchanges
.

These
are
the
main
proponents
of
program
trading
.

Defending
their
ramparts
are
Wall
Street
's
Old
Guard
--
the
traditional
,
stock-picking
money
managers
,
tens
of
thousands
of
stock
brokers
,
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
's
listed
companies
and
the
clannish
floor
traders
,
known
as
specialists
,
who
make
markets
in
their
stocks
.

So
far
,
Wall
Street
's
Old
Guard
seems
to
be
winning
the
program-trading
battle
,
successfully
mobilizing
public
and
congressional
opinion
to
bludgeon
their
tormentors
.

The
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
,
a
major
futures
marketplace
,
yesterday
announced
the
addition
of
another
layer
of
trading
halts
designed
to
slow
program
traders
during
a
rapidly
falling
stock
market
,
and
the
Big
Board
is
expected
today
to
approve
some
additional
restrictions
on
program
trading
.

Stung
by
charges
that
their
greed
is
turning
the
stock
market
into
a
gigantic
crapshoot
,
almost
all
the
big
investment
banking
houses
have
abandoned
index
arbitrage
,
a
common
form
of
program
trading
,
for
their
own
accounts
in
the
past
few
days
.

A
few
,
such
as
giant
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
,
now
refuse
even
to
do
index
arbitrage
trades
for
clients
.

The
Old
Guard
's
assault
on
program
trading
and
its
practitioners
has
been
fierce
and
broad-based
,
in
part
because
some
Old
Guard
members
feel
their
very
livelihood
is
at
stake
.

Some
,
such
as
traditional
money
manager
Neuberger
&
Berman
,
have
taken
out
national
newspaper
advertisements
demanding
that
market
regulators
``
stop
the
numbers
racket
on
Wall
Street
.

''

Big
Board
stock
specialists
,
in
a
bold
palace
revolt
,
began
shortly
after
Oct.
13
to
telephone
the
corporate
executives
of
the
companies
whose
stock
is
listed
on
the
Big
Board
to
have
them
pressure
the
exchange
to
ban
program
trading
.

Charles
Wohlstetter
,
the
chairman
of
Contel
Corp.

who
is
rallying
other
CEOs
to
the
anti-program
trading
cause
,
says
he
has
received
``
countless
''
letters
offering
support
.

``
They
said
universally
,
without
a
single
exception
:
Do
n't
even
compromise
.

Kill
it
,
''
he
says
.

Wall
Street
's
New
Guard
is
n't
likely
to
take
all
this
lying
down
for
long
,
however
.

Its
new
products
and
trading
techniques
have
been
highly
profitable
.

Program
trading
money
managers
have
gained
control
over
a
big
chunk
of
the
invested
funds
in
this
country
,
and
the
pressures
on
such
money
managers
to
produce
consistent
profits
has
wedded
them
to
the
ability
to
move
rapidly
in
and
out
the
market

that
program
trading
gives
them
.

What
's
more
,
the
last
time
major
Wall
Street
firms
said
they
were
getting
out
of
program
trading
--
in
the
aftermath
of
the
1987
crash
--
they
waited
a
few
months
and
then
sneaked
back
into
it
.

Even
some
members
of
the
Old
Guard
,
despite
their
current
advantage
,
seem
to
be
conceding
that
the
future
belongs
with
the
New
Guard
.

Last
week
,
Robert
M.
Bradley
,
one
of
the
Big
Board
's
most
respected
floor
traders
and
head
of
a
major
traders
'
organization
,
surrendered
.

He
sold
his
exchange
seat
and
wrote
a
bitter
letter
to
Big
Board
Chairman
John
J.
Phelan
Jr.
in
which

he
said
the
Big
Board
is
too
focused
on
machines
,
rather
than
people
.

He
said
the
exchange
is
``
headed
for
a
real
crisis
''
if
program
trading
is
n't
curbed
.

``
I
do
not
want
my
money
invested
in
what

I
consider
as
nothing
more
than
a
casino
,
''
Mr.
Bradley
wrote
.

The
battle
has
turned
into
a
civil
war
at
some
firms
and
organizations
,
causing
internal
contradictions
and
pitting
employee
against
employee
.

At
Kidder
,
a
unit
of
General
Electric
Co.
,
and
other
big
brokerage
firms
,
stockbrokers
battle
their
own
firm
's
program
traders

a
few
floors
away
.

Corporations
like
Contel
denounce
program
trading
,
yet
Contel
has
in
the
past
hired
pension
fund
managers
like
Bankers
Trust
Co.

that
are
also
big
program
traders
.

The
Big
Board
--
the
nation
's
premier
stock
exchange
--
is
sharply
divided
between
its
floor
traders
and
its
top
executives
.

Its
entrenched
49
stock
specialists
firms
are
fighting
tooth
and
nail
against
programs
.

But
the
Big
Board
's
leadership
--
over
the
specialists
'
protests
--
two
weeks
ago
began
trading
a
new
stock
``
basket
''
product
designed
to
facilitate
program
trading
.

``
A
lot
of
people
would
like
to
go
back
to
1970
,
''
before
program
trading
,
Mr.
Phelan
said

``
I
would
like
to
go
back
to
1970
.

But
we
are
not
going
back
to
1970
.

''

Again
and
again
,
program-trading
's
critics
raise
the
``
casino
''
theme
.

They
say
greedy
market
manipulators
have
made
a
shambles
of
the
nation
's
free-enterprise
system
,
turning
the
stock
market
into
a
big
gambling
den
,
with
the
odds
heavily
stacked
against
the
small
investor
.

``
The
public
did
n't
come
to
the
market
to
play
a
game
;
they
can
go
to
Off-Track
Betting
for
that
,
''
says
A.
Brean
Murray
,
chairman
of
Brean
Murray
,
Foster
Securities
,
a
traditional
money
management
firm
.

The
program
traders
,
on
the
other
hand
,
portray
old-fashioned
stock
pickers
as
the
Neanderthals
of
the
industry
.

Critics
like
Mr.
Murray
``
are
looking
for
witches
,
and
people

who
use
computers
to
trade
are
a
convenient
boogieman
,
''
says
J.
Thomas
Allen
,
president
of
Advanced
Investment
Management
Inc.
,
a
Pittsburgh
firm

that
runs
a
$
200
million
fund

that
uses
index
arbitrage
.

``
Just
a
blind
fear
of
the
unknown
is
causing
them
to
beg
the
regulators
for
protection
.

''

For
all
the
furor
,
there
is
nothing
particularly
complex
about
the
concept
of
stock-index
arbitrage
,
the
most
controversial
type
of
computer-assisted
program
trading
.

Like
other
forms
of
arbitrage
,
it
merely
seeks
to
take
advantage
of
momentary
discrepancies
in
the
price
of
a
single
product
--
in
this
case
,
a
basket
of
stocks
--
in
different
markets
--
in
this
case

the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
and
the
Chicago
futures
markets
.

That
divergence
is
what
stock
index
traders
seek
.

When
it
occurs
,
the
traders
place
orders
via
computers
to
buy
the
basket
of
stocks
(
such
as
the
500
stocks

that
constitute
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
stock
index
)
in
whichever
market
is
cheaper
and
sell
them
in
the
more
expensive
market
;
they
lock
in
the
difference
in
price
as
profit
.

Such
program
trades
,
which
can
involve
the
purchase
or
sale
of
millions
of
dollars
of
stock
,
occur
in
a
matter
of
seconds
.

A
program
trade
of
$
5
million
of
stock
typically
earns
a
razor-thin
profit
of
$
25,000
.

To
keep
program-trading
units
profitable
in
the
eyes
of
senior
brokerage
executives
,
traders
must
seize
every
opportunity
their
computers
find
.

The
speed
with
which

such
program
trades
take
place
and
the
volatile
price
movements
they
can
cause
are
what
program
trading
critics
profess
to
despise
.

``
If
you
continue
to
do
this
,
the
investor
becomes
frightened
--
any
investor
:
the
odd
lotter
,
mutual
funds
and
pension
funds
,
''
says
Larry
Zicklin
,
managing
partner
at
Neuberger
&
Berman
.

But
many
experts
and
traders
say
that
program
trading
is
n't
the
main
reason
for
stock-market
gyrations
.

``
I
have
not
seen
one
iota
of
evidence
''
to
support
restrictions
on
program
trading
,
says
a
Vanderbilt
University
finance
professor
,
Hans
Stoll
,
an
authority
on
the
subject
.

Says
the
Big
Board
's
Mr.
Phelan
,
``
Volatility
is
greater
than
program
trading
.

''

The
Oct.
13
plunge
was
triggered
not
by
program
traders
,
but
by
news
of
the
unraveling
of
the
$
6.79
billion
buy-out
of
UAL
Corp
.

Unable
to
unload
UAL
and
other
airline
shares
,
takeover-stock
speculators
,
or
risk
arbitragers
,
dumped
every
blue-chip
stock

they
had
.

While
program
trades
swiftly
kicked
in
,
a
``
circuit
breaker
''
that
halted
trading
in
stock
futures
in
Chicago
made
some
program
trading
impossible
.

Susan
Del
Signore
,
head
trader
at
Travelers
Investment
Management
Co.
,
says
critics
are
ignoring
``
the
role

the
{
takeover
stock
}
speculator
is
taking
in
the
market
as
a
source
of
volatility
.

''
Many
arbs
are
``
overleveraged
,
''
she
says
,
and
they
``
have
to
sell
when
things
look
like
they
fall
apart
.

''

Like
virtually
everything
on
Wall
Street
,
the
program-trading
battle
is
over
money
,
and
the
traditionalists
have
been
losing
out
on
bundles
of
it
to
the
New
Guard
in
recent
years
.

Take
the
traditional
money
managers
,
or
``
stock
pickers
,
''
as
they
are
derisively
known
among
the
computer
jockeys
.

Traditional
stock
managers
like
to
charge
50
cents
to
75
cents
for
every
$
100

they
manage
for
big
institutional
investors
,
and
higher
fees
for
smaller
investors
.

Yet
many
such
managers
consistently
fail
to
even
keep
up
with
,
much
less
beat
,
the
returns
of
standard
benchmarks
like
the
S&P

Not
surprisingly
,
old-style
money
managers
have
been
losing
clients
to
giant
stock-index
funds

that
use
computers
to
juggle
portfolios
so
they
mirror
the
S&P
500
.

The
indexers
charge
only
a
few
pennies
per
$
100
managed
.

Today
,
about
$
200
billion
,
or
20
%
of
all
pension-fund
stock
investments
,
is
held
by
index
funds
.

The
new
Wall
Street
of
computers
and
automated
trading
threatens
to
make
dinosaurs
of
the
49
Big
Board
stock-specialist
firms
.

These
small
but
influential
floor
brokers
long
have
earned
fat
returns
of
30
%
to
40
%

a
year
on
their
capital
,
by
virtue
of
their
monopoly
in
making
markets
in
individual
stocks
.

The
specialists
see
any
step
to
electronic
trading
as
a
death
knell
.

And
they
believe
the
Big
Board
,
under
Mr.
Phelan
,
has
abandoned
their
interest
.

The
son
of
a
specialist
and
once
one

himself
,
Mr.
Phelan
has
nonetheless
been
striving
--
with
products
like
the
new
stock
basket
that
his
former
colleagues
dislike
so
much
--
to
keep
index
funds
and
other
program
traders
from
taking
their
business
to
overseas
markets
.

Meanwhile
,
specialists
'
trading
risks
have
skyrocketed
as
a
result
of
stock-market
volatility
.

``
When
the
sell
programs
hit
,
you
can
hear
the
order
printers
start
to
go
''
on
the
Big
Board
trading
floor
,
says
one
specialist
there
.

``
The
buyers
walk
away
,
and
the
specialist
is
left
alone
''
as
the
buyer
of
last
resort
for
his
stable
of
stocks
,
he
contends
.

No
one
is
more
unhappy
with
program
trading
than
the
nation
's
stockbrokers
.

They
are
still
trying
to
lure
back
small
investors
spooked
by
the
1987
stock-market
crash
and
the
market
's
swings
since
then
.

``
Small
investors
are
absolutely
dismayed
that
Wall
Street
is
stacking
the
deck
against
them
,
and
these
wide
swings
are
scaring
them
to
death
,
''
says
Raymond
A.
Mason
,
chairman
of
regional
broker
Legg
Mason
Inc.
in
Baltimore
.

Stockbrokers
'
business
and
pay
has
been
falling
.

Last
year
,
the
average
broker
earned
$
71,309
,
24
%
lower
than
in
1987
.

Corporate
executives
resent
that
their
company
's
stock
has
been
transformed
into
a
nameless
piece
of
a
stock-index
basket
.

Index
traders

who
buy
all
500
stocks
in
the
S&P
500
often
do
n't
even
know
what

the
companies
they
own
actually
do
,
complains
Andrew
Sigler
,
chairman
of
Champion
International
Corp
.

``
Do
you
make
sweatshirts
or
sparkplugs
?

Oh
,
you
're
in
the
paper
business
,
''
is
one
reaction
Mr.
Sigler
says
he
's
gotten
from
his
big
institutional
shareholders
.

By
this
September
,
program
traders
were
doing
a
record
13.8
%
of
the
Big
Board
's
average
daily
trading
volume
.

Among
the
top
practitioners
were
Wall
Street
blue
bloods
:
Morgan
Stanley
&
Co.
,
Kidder
Peabody
,
Merrill
Lynch
,
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
and
PaineWebber
Group
Inc
.

But
then
came
Oct.
13
and
the
negative
publicity
orchestrated
by
the
Old
Guard
,
particularly
against
index
arbitrage
.

The
indexers
'
strategy
for
the
moment
is
to
hunker
down
and
let
the
furor
die
.

``
There
's
a
lynch-mob
psychology
right
now
,
''
says
the
top
program-trading
official
at
a
Wall
Street
firm
.

``
Wall
Street
's
cash
cow
has
been
gored
,
but
I
do
n't
think
anyone
has
proven
that
index
arbitrage
is
the
problem
.

''

Too
much
money
is
at
stake
for
program
traders
to
give
up
.

For
example
,
stock-index
futures
began
trading
in
Chicago
in
1982
,
and
within
two
years
they
were
the
fastest-growing
futures
contract
ever
launched
.

Stock
futures
trading
has
minted
dozens
of
millionaires
in
their
20s
and
30s
.

Now
,
on
a
good
day
,
Chicago
's
stock-index
traders
trade
more
dollars
worth
of
stock
futures
than
the
Big
Board
trades
in
stock
.

Now
the
stage
is
set
for
the
battle
to
play
out
.

The
anti-programmers
are
getting
some
helpful
thunder
from
Congress
.

Program
traders
'
``
power
to
create
total
panic
is
so
great
that
they
ca
n't
be
allowed
to
have
their
way
,
''
says
Rep.
Edward
Markey
,
a
Massachusetts
Democrat
.

``
We
have
to
have
a
system

that
says
to
those
largest
investors
:
`
Sit
down
!

You
will
not
panic
,
you
will
not
put
the
financial
system
in
jeopardy
.

'
''

But
the
prospects
for
legislation

that
targets
program
trading
is
unlikely
anytime
soon
.

Many
people
,
including
the
Big
Board
,
think
that
it
's
too
late
to
put
the
genie
back
in
the
bottle
.

The
Big
Board
's
directors
meet
today
to
approve
some
program-trading
restrictions
,
but
a
total
ban
is
n't
being
considered
,
Big
Board
officials
say
.

``
You
're
not
going
to
stop
the
idea
of
trading
a
basket
of
stocks
,
''
says
Vanderbilt
's
Prof.
Stoll
.

``
Program
trading
is
here
to
stay
,
and
computers
are
here
to
stay
,
and
we
just
need
to
understand
it
.

''

Short
of
a
total
ban
,
some
anti-programmers
have
proposed
several
middle-ground
reforms
,
which

they
say
would
take
away
certain
advantages
program
traders
currently
enjoy
in
the
marketplace
that
other
investors
do
n't
.

One
such
proposal
regarding
stock-index
futures
is
an
increase
in
the
margin
requirement
--
or
the
``
good-faith
''
payment
of
cash
needed
to
trade
them
--
to
about
the
same
level
as
the
margin
requirement
for
stocks
.

Currently
,
margins
on
stock
futures
purchases
are
much
lower
--
roughly
7
%
compared
with
50
%
for
stocks
--
making
the
futures
market
much
faster
and
potentially
more
speculative
.

Program
trading
critics
also
want
the
Federal
Reserve
Board
,
rather
than
the
futures
industry
,
to
set
such
margins
.

Futures
traders
respond
that
low
margins
help
keep
their
markets
active
.

Higher
margins
would
chase
away
dozens
of
smaller
traders

who
help
larger
traders
buy
and
sell
,
they
say
.

Another
proposed
reform
is
to
have
program
traders
answer
to
an
``
uptick
rule
''
a
reform
instituted
after
the
Great
Crash
of
1929

that
protects
against
stocks
being
relentlessly
beaten
downward
by
those
seeking
to
profit
from
lower
prices
,
namely
short
sellers
.

The
Big
Board
's
uptick
rule
prevents
the
short
sale
of
a
stock
when
the
stock
is
falling
in
price
.

But
in
1986
,
program
traders
received
what
amounted
to
an
exemption
from
the
uptick
rule
in
certain
situations
,
to
make
it
easier
to
link
the
stock
and
futures
markets
.

A
reinstatement
of
the
uptick
rule
for
program
traders
would
slow
their
activity
considerably
.

Program
traders
argue
that
a
reinstatement
of
the
rule
would
destroy
the
``
pricing
efficiency
''
of
the
futures
and
stock
markets
.

Fundamentalists
Jihad

Big
Board
Chairman
John
Phelan
said
yesterday
that
he
could
support
letting
federal
regulators
suspend
program
trading
during
wild
stock-price
swings
.

Thus
the
band-wagon
psychology
of
recent
days
picks
up
new
impetus
.

Index
arbitrage
is
a
common
form
of
program
trading
.

As
usually
practiced
it
takes
advantage
of
a
rather
basic
concept
:
Two
separate
markets
in
different
locations
,
trading
basically
the
same
widgets
,
ca
n't
trade
them
for
long
at
prices

that
are
widely
different
.

In
index
arbitrage
,
the
widget
is
the
S&P
500
,
and
its
price
is
constantly
compared
between
the
futures
market
in
Chicago
and
the
stock
markets
largely
in
New
York
.

To
profit
from
an
index-arbitrage
opportunity
,
someone

who
owns
the
S&P
500
widget
in
New
York
must
sell
it
and
replace
it
with
a
cheaper
S&P
500
widget
in
Chicago
.

If
the
money
manager
performing
this
service
is
being
paid
by
his
clients
to
match
or
beat
the
return
of
the
S&P
500
index
,
he
is
likely
to
remain
fully
invested
at
all
times
.

(
Few
,
if
any
,
index-fund
managers
will
risk
leveraging
performance
by
owning
more
than
100
%
exposure
to
stocks
,
and
equally
few
will
want
to
own
less
than
a
100
%
position
should
stocks
rise
.

)

By
constantly
seeking
to
own
the
cheapest
widget
,
index-arbitrage
traders
hope
to
add
between
1
%
and
3
%
to
the
annual
return
of
the
S&P
500
.

That
represents
a
very
thin
``
excess
''
return
,
certainly
far
less
than
what

most
fundamental
stock
pickers
claim
to
seek
as
their
performance
objective
.

The
fact
that
a
vast
majority
of
fundamentalist
money
managers
fail
to
beat
the
S&P
500
may
contribute
to
the
hysteria
surrounding
the
issue
.

As
more
managers
pursue
the
index-arbitrage
strategy
,
these
small
opportunities
between
markets
will
be
reduced
and
,
eventually
,
eliminated
.

The
current
opportunities
arise
because
the
process
for
executing
a
buy
or
sell
order
in
the
actual
stocks

that
make
up
the
S&P
500
is
more
cumbersome
than
transacting
in
the
futures
market
.

The
New
York
Stock
Exchange
's
attempt
to
introduce
a
new
portfolio
basket
is
evidence
of
investors
'
desires
to
make
fast
and
easy
transactions
of
large
numbers
of
shares
.

So
if
index
arbitrage
is
simply
taking
advantage
of
thin
inefficiencies
between
two
markets
for
the
same
widget
,
how
did
``
program
trading
''
evolve
into
the
evil
creature

that
is
evoking
the
curses
of
so
many
observers
?

All
arguments
against
program
trading
,
even
those
pressed
without
fact
,
conclude
with
three
expected
results
after
``
reforms
''
are
implemented
:
1
)
reduced
volatility
,
2
)
a
long-term
investment
focus
,
and
3
)
a
level
playing
field
for
the
small
investor
.

But
many
of
these
reforms
are
unneeded
,
even
harmful
.

Reducing
volatility
.

An
index-arbitrage
trade
is
never
executed
unless
there
is
sufficient
difference
between
the
markets
in
New
York
and
Chicago
to
cover
all
transaction
costs
.

Arbitrage
does
n't
cause
volatility
;
it
responds
to
it
.

Think
about
what
causes
the
difference
in
prices
between
the
two
markets
for
S&P
500
stocks
--
usually
it
is
large
investors
initiating
a
buy
or
sell
in
Chicago
.

A
large
investor
will
likely
cause
the
futures
market
to
decline
when
he
sells
his
futures
.

Arbitrage
simply
transfers
his
selling
pressure
from
Chicago
to
New
York
,
while
functioning
as
a
buyer
in
Chicago
.

The
start
of
the
whole
process
is
the
key
-
someone
must
fundamentally
increase
or
decrease
his
ownership
in
widgets
to
make
widget
prices
move
.

Why
does
this
large
hypothetical
seller
trade
in
Chicago
instead
of
New
York
?

Perhaps
he
is
willing
to
sacrifice
to
the
arbitrage
trader

some
small
profit
in
order
to
get
quick
and
certain
execution
of
his
large
trade
.

In
a
competitive
market
,
this
investor
has
many
ways
to
execute
his
transactions
,
and
he
will
have
more
alternatives
(
both
foreign
and
domestic
)
if
his
volume
is
profitable
for
an
exchange
to
handle
.

If
not
Chicago
,
then
in
New
York
;
if
not
the
U.S.
,
then
overseas
.

Volatility
surrounding
his
trades
occurs
not
because
of
index
arbitrage
,
but
because
his
is
a
large
addition
or
subtraction
to
a
widget
market
with
finite
liquidity
.

Eliminate
arbitrage
and
liquidity
will
decline
instead
of
rising
,
creating
more
volatility
instead
of
less
.

The
speed
of
his
transaction
is
n't
to
be
feared
either
,
because
faster
and
cleaner
execution
is
desirable
,
not
loathsome
.

If
slowing
things
down
could
reduce
volatility
,
stone
tablets
should
become
the
trade
ticket
of
the
future
.

Encouraging
long-term
investing
.

We
must
be
very
cautious
about
labeling
investors
as
``
long-term
''
or
``
short-term
.

''
Policies
designed
to
encourage
one
type
of
investor
over
another
are
akin
to
placing
a
sign
over
the
Big
Board
's
door
saying
:
``
Buyers
welcome
,
sellers
please
go
away
!

''
The
ultimate
goal
of
any
investor
is
a
profit
motive
,
and
regulators
should
not
concern
themselves
with
whether
investors
are
sufficiently
focused
on
the
long
term
.

A
free
market
with
a
profit
motive
will
attract
each
investor
to
the
liquidity
and
risks
he
can
tolerate
.

In
point
of
fact
,
volatility
as
measured
by
the
annualized
standard
deviation
of
daily
stock
price
movements
has
frequently
been
much
higher
than
it
is
today
.

Periods
before
the
advent
of
futures
or
program
trading
were
often
more
volatile
,
usually
when
fundamental
market
conditions
were
undergoing
change
(
1973-75
,
1937-40
,
and
1928-33
for
example
)
.

It
is
interesting
to
see
the
fundamental
stock
pickers
scream
``
foul
''
on
program
trading
when
the
markets
decline
,
while
hailing
the
great
values
still
abounding
as
the
markets
rise
.

Could
rising
volatility
possibly
be
related
to
uncertainty
about
the
economics
of
stocks
,
instead
of
the
evil
deeds
of
program-trading
goblins
?

Some
of
the
proposed
fixes
for
what
is
labeled
``
program-trading
volatility
''
could
be
far
worse
than
the
perceived
problem
.

In
using
program
trading
as
a
whipping
boy
,
fundamentalist
investors
stand
to
gain
the
high
ground
in
wooing
small
investors
for
their
existing
stock-selection
products
.

They
may
,
however
,
risk
bringing
some
damaging
interference
from
outside
the
markets
themselves
.

How
does
a
nice
new
tax
,
say
5
%
,
on
any
financial
transaction
sound
?

That
ought
to
make
sure
we
're
all
thinking
for
the
long
term
.

Getting
a
level
playing
field
.

This
argument
is
perhaps
the
most
interesting
one
for
abolishing
program
trading
--
not
because
of
its
merits
,
but
because
of
the
firms
championing
the
cause
.

The
loudest
of
these
reformers
are
money
managers

who
cater
to
smaller
investors
.

They
continually
advise
their
clients
on
which

individual
stocks
to
buy
or
sell
,
while
their
clients
continue
to
hope
for
superior
performance
.

Even
with
mutual
funds
,
the
little
investor
continues
to
tolerate
high
fees
,
high
commissions
and
poor
performance
,
while
index-fund
managers
slowly
amass
a
better
record
with
lower
fees
,
lower
commissions
and
less
risk
.

Yet
our
efforts
are
somehow
less
noble
than
those
of
an
investment
expert
studiously
devouring
press
clippings
on
each
company

he
follows
.

Almost
all
new
regulation
is
introduced
in
the
interests
of
protecting
the
little
guy
,
and
he
invariably
is
the
one
least
able
to
cope
with
its
consequences
.

If
spreads
available
from
index
arbitrage
are
so
enormous
,
surely
any
sizable
mutual-fund
company
could
profit
from
offering
it
to
small
investors
.

The
sad
reality
is
that
the
retail
investor
continues
to
pursue
stellar
performers
first
,
while
leaving
institutions
to
grapple
with
basis
points
of
performance
on
large
sums
of
money
quarter
by
quarter
.

Cost-effective
index
funds
just
are
n't
sexy
enough
to
justify
the
high
fees
and
commissions
that
retail
customers
frequently
pay
,
and
that
institutional
customers
refuse
to
pay
.

Each
new
trading
roadblock
is
likely
to
be
beaten
by
institutions
seeking
better
ways
to
serve
their
high-volume
clients
,
here
or
overseas
.

Legislating
new
trading
inefficiencies
will
only
make
things
harder
on
the
least
sophisticated
investors
.

So
what
is
next
for
program
trading
?

Left
to
its
own
devices
,
index
arbitrage
will
become
more
and
more
efficient
,
making
it
harder
and
harder
to
do
profitably
.

Spreads
will
become
so
tight
that
it
wo
n't
matter
which
market

an
investor
chooses
--
arbitrage
will
prevent
him
from
gaining
any
temporary
profit
.

If
government
or
private
watchdogs
insist
,
however
,
on
introducing
greater
friction
between
the
markets
(
limits
on
price
moves
,
two-tiered
execution
,
higher
margin
requirements
,
taxation
,
etc.
)
,
the
end
loser
will
be
the
markets
themselves
.

Instead
,
we
ought
to
be
inviting
more
liquidity
with
cheaper
ways
to
trade
and
transfer
capital
among
all
participants
.

David
A.
DiLoreto
,
president
of
metal
container
division
,
was
named
to
the
additional
post
of
group
vice
president
,
packaging
products
,
at
this
packaging
,
industrial
and
aerospace
products
concern
,
succeeding
Delmont
A.
Davis
,
who
was
named
president
and
chief
operating
officer
in
August
.

For
six
years
,
T.
Marshall
Hahn
Jr.
has
made
corporate
acquisitions
in
the
George
Bush
mode
:
kind
and
gentle
.

The
question
now
:
Can
he
act
more
like
hard-charging
Teddy
Roosevelt
?

Mr.
Hahn
,
the
62-year-old
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Georgia-Pacific
Corp.
is
leading
the
forest-product
concern
's
unsolicited
$
3.19
billion
bid
for
Great
Northern
Nekoosa
Corp
.

Nekoosa
has
given
the
offer

a
public
cold
shoulder
,
a
reaction
Mr.
Hahn
has
n't
faced
in
his
18
earlier
acquisitions
,
all
of
which
were
negotiated
behind
the
scenes
.

So
far
,
Mr.
Hahn
is
trying
to
entice
Nekoosa
into
negotiating
a
friendly
surrender
while
talking
tough
.

``
We
are
prepared
to
pursue
aggressively
completion
of
this
transaction
,
''
he
says
.

But
a
takeover
battle
opens
up
the
possibility
of
a
bidding
war
,
with
all
that
implies
.

If
a
competitor
enters
the
game
,
for
example
,
Mr.
Hahn
could
face
the
dilemma
of
paying
a
premium
for
Nekoosa
or
seeing
the
company
fall
into
the
arms
of
a
rival
.

Given
that
choice
,
associates
of
Mr.
Hahn
and
industry
observers
say
the
former
university
president
--
who
has
developed
a
reputation
for
not
overpaying
for
anything
--
would
fold
.

``
There
's
a
price
above
which

I
'm
positive
Marshall
has
the
courage
not
to
pay
,
''
says
A.D.
Correll
,
Georgia-Pacific
's
executive
vice
president
for
pulp
and
paper
.

Says
long-time
associate
Jerry
Griffin
,
vice
president
,
corporate
development
,
at
WTD
Industries
Inc.
:
``
He
is
n't
of
the
old
school
of
winning
at
any
cost
.

''

He
also
is
a
consensus
manager
,
insiders
say
.

The
decision
to
make
the
bid
for
Nekoosa
,
for
example
,
was
made
only
after
all
six
members
of
Georgia-Pacific
's
management
committee
signed
onto
the
deal
--
even
though
Mr.
Hahn
knew
he
wanted
to
go
after
the
company
early
on
,
says
Mr.
Correll
.

Associates
say
Mr.
Hahn
picked
up
that
careful
approach
to
management
as
president
of
Virginia
Polytechnic
Institute
.

Assuming
that
post
at
the
age
of
35
,
he
managed
by
consensus
,
as
is
the
rule
in
universities
,
says
Warren
H.
Strother
,
a
university
official

who
is
researching
a
book
on
Mr.
Hahn
.

But
he
also
showed
a
willingness
to
take
a
strong
stand
.

In
1970
,
Mr.
Hahn
called
in
state
police
to
arrest
student
protesters

who
were
occupying
a
university
building
.

That
impressed
Robert
B.
Pamplin
,
Georgia-Pacific
's
chief
executive
at
the
time
,
whom
Mr.
Hahn
had
met
while
fundraising
for
the
institute
.

In
1975
,
Mr.
Pamplin
enticed
Mr.
Hahn
into
joining
the
company
as
executive
vice
president
in
charge
of
chemicals
;
the
move
befuddled
many
in
Georgia-Pacific

who
did
n't
believe
a
university
administrator
could
make
the
transition
to
the
corporate
world
.

But
Mr.
Hahn
rose
swiftly
through
the
ranks
,
demonstrating
a
raw
intelligence
that
he
says
he
knew
he
possessed
early
on
.

The
son
of
a
physicist
,
Mr.
Hahn
skipped
first
grade
because
his
reading
ability
was
so
far
above
his
classmates
.

Moving
rapidly
through
school
,
he
graduated
Phi
Beta
Kappa
from
the
University
of
Kentucky
at
age
18
,
after
spending
only
2
years
in
college
.

He
earned
his
doctorate
in
nuclear
physics
from
the
Massachusetts
Institute
of
Technology
.

Mr.
Hahn
agrees
that
he
has
a
``
retentive
''
memory
,
but
friends
say
that
's
an
understatement
.

They
call
it
``
photographic
''
.

Mr.
Hahn
also
has
engineered
a
surprising
turnaround
of
Georgia-Pacific
.

Taking
over
as
chief
executive
officer
in
1983
,
he
inherited
a
company

that
was
mired
in
debt
and
hurt
by
a
recession-inspired
slide
in
its
building-products
business
.

Mr.
Hahn
began
selling
non-core
businesses
,
such
as
oil
and
gas
and
chemicals
.

He
even
sold
one
unit

that
made
vinyl
checkbook
covers
.

At
the
same
time
,
he
began
building
up
the
pulp
and
paper
segment
of
the
company
while
refocusing
building
products
on
home
repair
and
remodeling
,
rather
than
materials
for
new-home
construction
.

The
idea
was
to
buffet
building
products
from
cycles
in
new-home
construction
.

The
formula
has
paid
off
,
so
far
.

Georgia-Pacific
's
sales
climbed
to
$
9.5
billion
last
year
,
compared
with
$
6
billion
in
1983
,
when
Mr.
Hahn
took
the
reins
.

Profit
from
continuing
operations
has
soared
to
$
467
million
from
$
75
million
.

Mr.
Hahn
attributes
the
gains
to
the
philosophy
of
concentrating
on
what

a
company
knows
best
.

``
The
record
of
companies

that
have
diversified
is
n't
all
that
impressive
,
''
he
says
.

Nekoosa
would
n't
be
a
diversification
.

It
would
be
a
good
match
,
Mr.
Hahn
and
many
analysts
say
,
of
two
healthy
companies
with
high-quality
assets
and
strong
cash
flows
.

The
resulting
company
would
be
the
largest
forest-products
concern
in
the
world
with
combined
sales
of
more
than
$
13
billion
.

But
can
Mr.
Hahn
carry
it
off
?

In
this
instance
,
industry
observers
say
,
he
is
entering
uncharted
waters
.

Says
Kathryn
McAuley
,
an
analyst
at
First
Manhattan
Co.
:
``
This
is
the
greatest
acquisition
challenge

he
has
faced
.

The
record
corn-buying
binge
by
the
Soviet
Union
is
causing
serious
bottlenecks
in
the
U.S.
grain
pipeline
.

The
Soviet
purchases
are
so
massive
that
exporters
are
struggling
to
find
enough
river
barges
and
trains
to
move
the
recently
harvested
Midwest
crop
to
ports
for
loading
onto
Soviet
ships
.

River
barge
rates
have
soared
40
%

this
fall
from
a
year
earlier
.

Railroad
companies
and
some
ports
are
reaping
a
sudden
windfall
of
business
.

And
some
grain
analysts
are
predicting
that
corn
prices
might
gyrate
this
month
as
exporters
scrounge
to
find
enough
of
the
crop
to
meet
their
obligations
to
the
Soviets
.

The
Soviet
Union
bought
roughly
310
million
bushels
of
U.S.
corn
in
October
,
which
is
the
most
ever
sold
to
the
Soviet
Union
in
one
month
from
the
U.S
.

The
Soviet
Union
wants
much
of
it
delivered
by
January
,
which
would
be
a
strain
in
most
years
.

But
it
is
particularly
difficult

this
autumn
because
of
low
water
levels
on
the
Mississippi
River
,
on
which
flows
much
of
the
U.S.
corn

that
is
shipped
overseas
.

``
We
are
shipping
the
most
corn
in
that
short
of
time
period
to
one
customer
on
record
,
''
said
William
Dunton
,
a
U.S.
Agriculture
Department
transportation
expert
.

``
It
is
going
to
be
real
tight
.

''

Because
of
persistent
dry
weather
in
the
northern
Plains
,
the
water
level
on
the
upper
section
of
the
Mississippi
River
is
so
low
that
many
river
operators
are
already
trimming
the
number
of
barges
their
tows
push
at
one
time
.

In
a
few
weeks
,
many
barges
probably
wo
n't
be
able
to
operate
fully
loaded
south
of
St.
Louis
because
the
U.S.
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
is
beginning
to
reduce
the
flow
of
the
Missouri
River
,
which
feeds
into
the
Mississippi
River
.

The
Army
Corps
is
cutting
the
flow
of
the
Missouri
River
about
two
weeks
earlier
than
normal
because
of
low
water
levels
in
the
reservoirs

that
feed
it
.

Barge
rates
on
the
Mississippi
River
sank
yesterday
on
speculation
that
widespread
rain

this
week
in
the
Midwest
might
temporarily
alleviate
the
situation
.

But
the
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
expects
the
river
level
to
continue
falling
this
month
.

At
St.
Louis
,
the
water
level
of
the
Mississippi
River
is
already
6.5
feet
below
normal
and
it
could
drop
an
additional
2.5
feet
when
the
flow
of
the
Missouri
River
is
slowed
,
an
Army
Corps
spokesman
said
.

Similar
levels
hamstrung
barge
shipments
last
year
in
the
wake
of
the
worst
drought
in
50
years
.

So
far
,
the
grain
industry
's
budding
logistical
problems
have
n't
been
a
major
factor
in
the
trading
of
corn
contracts
at
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
.

Many
grain
processors
and
exporters
use
the
price
of
the
corn
futures
contracts
traded
there
to
calculate
the
price

they
offer
to
buy
corn
from
farmers
.

At
the
Board
of
Trade
yesterday

the
price
of
the
corn
contract
for
December
delivery
slipped
3.5
cents

a
bushel
to
settle
at
$
2.375

a
bushel
.

Corn
prices
have
been
sluggish
this
fall
despite
the
huge
Soviet
orders
because
the
harvest
has
allowed
farmers
to
rebuild
the
stockpiles
depleted
by
the
1988
drought
.

With
the
harvest
winding
down
,
however
,
some
analysts
are
speculating
that
prices
might
jump
in
some
regions
as
U.S.
exporters
try
to
gather
the
corn

they
are
obligated
to
deliver
.

Farmers
are
in
the
best
position
of
many
years
to
push
up
corn
prices
.

Because
the
drought
reduced
U.S.
stockpiles
,
they
have
more
than
enough
storage
space
for
their
new
crop
,
and
that
permits
them
to
wait
for
prices
to
rise
.

In
parts
of
Iowa
,
for
example
,
some
grain
elevators
are
offering
farmers
$
2.15

a
bushel
for
corn
.

Many
farmers
probably
would
n't
sell
until
prices
rose
at
least
20
cents

a
bushel
,
said
Lyle
Reed
,
president
of
Chicago
Central
&
Pacific
Railroad
Co.
of
Waterloo
,
Iowa
.

It
is
n't
clear
,
however
,
who
would
win
a
waiting
game
.

Although
U.S.
corn
stockpiles
shrank
by
roughly
half
in
the
wake
of
the
drought
,
the
Agriculture
Department
projects
that
nearly
one-fifth
of
the
harvest
will
still
be
in
storage
before
the
1990
corn
harvest
begins
.

Some
analysts
are
worried
that
reports
of
the
grain
industry
's
problems
might
spark
investors
to
begin
buying
corn
futures
contracts
--
only
to
see
little
appreciation
.

``
The
public
is
buying
the
market
when
in
reality

there
is
plenty
of
grain
to
be
shipped
,
''
said
Bill
Biedermann
,
Allendale
Inc.
research
director
.

Although
much
of
this
country
's
export
corn
goes
to
New
Orleans
by
barge
,
it
is
possible
for
exporters
to
sidestep
the
Mississippi
River
by
shipping
a
larger-than-normal
amount
of
corn
by
train
to
the
port
.

Ports
in
the
Great
Lakes
and
Atlantic
Coast
can
also
relieve
pressure
on
New
Orleans
.

One
railroad
,
for
example
,
is
already
increasing
its
grain
hauling
service
from
Indiana
to
Baltimore
.

And
it
is
n't
clear
that
the
Soviet
Union
will
stay
on
its
record
buying
pace
.

The
Soviet
orders
were
compressed
into
the
month
of
October
because
of
delays
.

The
Soviet
Union
usually
begins
buying
U.S.
crops
earlier
in
the
fall
.

But
its
purchases
apparently
were
delayed
by
a
reorganization
of
its
agricultural
bureaucracy
as
well
as
budget
problems
.

In
other
commodity
markets
yesterday
:

ENERGY
:
Crude
oil
futures
prices
increased
in
moderate
trading
,
but
much
of
the
action
was
in
heating
oil
.

Prices
rose
on
the
news
that
a
sizable
West
German
refinery
was
damaged
in
a
fire
,
tightening
an
already
tight
European
market
.

Heating
oil
for
November
delivery
ended
at
58.64
cents

a
gallon
,
up
one
cent
on
the
New
York
Mercantile
Exchange
.

West
Texas
Intermediate
for
December
delivery
advanced
22
cents
to
$
19.94

a
barrel
.

Gasoline
futures
continued
a
sell-off

that
began
Monday
.

PRECIOUS
METALS
:
Futures
prices
eased
as
increased
stability
and
strength
came
into
the
securities
markets
.

December
delivery
gold
fell
$
3.20

an
ounce
to
$
377.60
.

December
silver
declined
6.50
cents

an
ounce
to
$
5.2180
.

January
platinum
was
down
$
5.70

an
ounce
at
$
494.50
.

Precious
metals
,
gold
in
particular
,
currently
are
being
influenced
more
by
stock
market
gyrations
than
the
dollar
as
traders
seek
greater
investment
stability
,
according
to
William
O'Neill
,
vice
president
of
research
at
Elders
Futures
in
New
York
.

``
The
recent
rally
in
precious
metals
was
a
result
of
uncertainty
and
volatility
in
equities
,
''
he
said
.

Yesterday
,
the
stock
market
rose
strongly
,
creating
a
more
defensive
attitude
among
precious
metals
traders
,
he
said
.

Silver
and
platinum
,
which
have
more
of
an
industrial
nature
than
gold
,
were
even
weaker
,
he
said
.

Silver
is
also
under
pressure
of
``
extremely
high
''
inventories
in
warehouses
of
the
Commodity
Exchange
,
he
said
.

Yesterday
,
these
stocks
rose
by
170,262
ounces
to
a
record
of
226,570,380
ounces
,
according
to
an
exchange
spokesman
.

COPPER
:
Futures
prices
partially
recovered
Monday
's
declines
because
Chilean
miners
voted
to
strike
.

The
December
contract
rose
1.20
cents

a
pound
to
$
1.14
.

In
Chile
,
workers
at
two
copper
mines
,
Los
Bronces
and
El
Soldado
,
which
belong
to
the
Exxon-owned
Minera
Disputada
,
yesterday
voted
to
begin
a
full
strike
tomorrow
,
an
analyst
said
.

Reasons
for
the
walkout
,
the
analyst
said
,
included
a
number
of
procedural
issues
,
such
as
a
right
to
strike
.

The
analyst
noted
that
also
inherent
in
all
metal
markets
was
a
sympathetic
reaction
to
stocks
.

In
the
case
of
copper
,
he
said
,
the
upbeat
mood
of
stocks
was
reflected
in
demand
for
futures
contracts
because
a
stronger
economy
means
greater
buying
interest
for
the
metal
.

Also
contributing
to
the
firmness
in
copper
,
the
analyst
noted
,
was
a
report
by
Chicago
purchasing
agents
,
which
precedes
the
full
purchasing
agents
'
report

that
is
due
out
today
and
gives
an
indication
of
what

the
full
report
might
hold
.

The
Purchasing
Management
Association
of
Chicago
's
October
index
rose
to
51.6
%
after
three
previous
months
of
readings
below
50
%
.

The
September
index
was
47.1
%
.

A
reading
below
50
%
generally
indicates
a
slowing
in
the
industrial
sector
of
the
economy
,
while
a
reading
above
50
%
points
to
expansion
.

The
Chicago
report
raised
the
possibility
that
the
October
survey
of
the
National
Association
of
Purchasing
Management
would
also
show
a
reading
above
50
%
.

Elco
Industries
Inc.
said
it
expects
net
income
in
the
year
ending
June
30
,
1990
,
to
fall
below
a
recent
analyst
's
estimate
of
$
1.65

a
share
.

The
Rockford
,
Ill.
,
maker
of
fasteners
also
said
it
expects
to
post
sales
in
the
current
fiscal
year

that
are
``
slightly
above
''
fiscal
1989
sales
of
$
155
million
.

The
company
said
its
industrial
unit
continues
to
face
margin
pressures
and
lower
demand
.

In
fiscal
1989
,
Elco
earned
$
7.8
million
,
or
$
1.65

a
share
.

The
company
's
stock
fell
$
1.125
to
$
13.625
in
over-the-counter
trading
yesterday
.

A
nickname
for
measures
to
stop
the
market
from
plunging
too
far
too
fast
.

Several
moves
were
taken
following
the
October
1987
crash
to
coordinate
--
and
sometimes
deliberately
disconnect
--
the
stock
and
futures
markets
in
times
of
heightened
volatility
.

On
the
Big
Board
,
a
``
side
car
''
is
put
into
effect
when
the
S&P
futures
rise
or
fall
12
points
.

The
side
car
routes
program
trades
into
a
special
computer
file

that
scans
for
imbalances
of
buy
and
sell
orders
.

On
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
,
S&P
500
futures
are
not
allowed
to
fall
further
than
12
points
from
the
previous
day
's
close
for
half
an
hour
.

If
,
when
trading
resumes
,
the
S&P
futures
fall
30
points
from
the
previous
day
's
close
,
a
one-hour
trading
halt
takes
effect
.

Also
,
the
reforms
allow
the
Big
Board
to
halt
trading
for
one
hour
if
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
falls
250
points
,
and
for
two
more
hours
if
the
Dow
slides
an
additional
150
points
on
the
same
day
.

Futures
Contracts
--
Obligations
to
buy
(
for
those

who
have
purchased
a
contract
)
or
deliver
(
for
those

who
sold
one
)
a
quantity
of
the
underlying
commodity
or
financial
instrument
at
the
agreed-upon
price
by
a
certain
date
.

Most
contracts
are
simply
nullified
by
an
opposite
trade
before
they
come
due
.

Indexing
--
Many
investors
,
mainly
institutions
,
follow
an
investment
strategy
of
buying
and
holding
a
mix
of
stocks
to
match
the
performance
of
a
broad
stock-market
barometer
such
as
the
S&P
500
.

Many
institutional
index
funds
are
active
program
traders
,
swapping
their
stocks
for
futures
when
profitable
to
do
so
.

Program
trading
--
A
wide
range
of
computer-assisted
portfolio
trading
strategies
involving
the
simultaneous
purchase
or
sale
of
15
or
more
stocks
.

Stock-index
arbitrage
--
Buying
or
selling
baskets
of
stocks
while
at
the
same
time
executing
offsetting
trades
in
stock-index
futures
or
options
.

Traders
profit
by
trying
to
capture
fleeting
price
discrepancies
between
stocks
and
the
index
futures
or
options
.

If
stocks
are
temporarily
``
cheaper
''
than
futures
,
for
example
,
an
arbitrager
will
buy
stocks
and
sell
futures
.

Stock-index
futures
--
Contracts
to
buy
or
sell
the
cash
value
of
a
stock
index
by
a
certain
date
.

The
cash
value
is
determined
by
multiplying
the
index
number
by
a
specified
amount
.

The
most
common
program-trading
vehicles
are
futures
contracts
on
Standard
&
poor

's
500-stock
index
(
traded
on
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
)
;
the
Major
Market
Index
,
a
20-stock
index
that
mimics

the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
(
traded
on
the
chicago
Board
of
Trade
)
;
and
the
S&P
100
options
(
traded
on
the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
,
and
based
on
100
stocks
selected
from
the
S&P
500
)
.

Stock-index
options
--
Options
give
holders

the
right
,
but
not
the
obligation
,
to
buy
(
a
call
)
or
sell
(
a
put

)
a
specified
amount
of
an
underlying
investment
by
a
certin
date
at
a
preset
price
,
known
as
the
strike
price
.

For
stock
indexes
,
the
underlying
investment
may
be
a
stock-index
futures
contract
or
the
cash
value
of
a
stock
index
.

For
example
,
there
are
options
on
the
S&P
500
futures
contract
and
on
the
S&P
100
index
.

Uptick

RMS
International
Inc.
,
Hasbrouk
Heights

N.J.
,
facing
a
cash-flow
squeeze
,
said
it
is
seeking
other
financing
sources
and
waivers
from
debenture
holders
.

The
company
said
that
because
of
softening
sales

it
is
n't
in
compliance
with
requirements
that
it
maintain
$
3
million
in

RMS
distributes
electronic

produces
power
supplies
and

said
it
had

of
$
158,666

or
10
cents

a

After
years
of
struggling
,
the
Los
Angeles
Herald
Examiner
will
publish
its
last
edition
today
,
shut
down
by
its
parent
,
Hearst
Corp.
,
following
unsuccessful
efforts
to
sell
the
venerable
newspaper
.

The
demise
of
the
238,000-circulation
Herald
,
once
the
nation
's
largest
afternoon
newspaper
with
circulation
exceeding
700,000
,
turns
the
country
's
second-largest
city
into
a
one-newspaper
town
,
at
least
in
some
senses
.

The
Los
Angeles
Times
,
with
a
circulation
of
more
than
1.1
million
,
dominates
the
region
.

But
it
faces
stiff
competition
in
Orange
County
from
the
Orange
County
Register
,
which
sells
more
than
300,000
copies

a
day
,
and
in
the
San
Fernando
Valley
from
the
Los
Angeles
Daily
News
,
which
sells
more
than
170,000
.

Nearby
cities
such
as
Pasadena
and
Long
Beach
also
have
large
dailies
.

In
July
,
closely
held
Hearst
,
based
in
New
York
,
put
the
paper
on
the
block
.

Speculation
had
it
that
the
company
was
asking
$
100
million
for
an
operation
said
to
be
losing
about
$
20
million

a
year
,
but
others
said
Hearst
might
have
virtually
given
the
paper
away
.

An
attempted
buy-out
led
by
John
J.
McCabe
,
chief
operating
officer
,
never
materialized
,
and
a
stream
of
what

one
staff
member
dismissed
as
``
tire-kickers
and
lookee-loos
''
had
filed
through
since
.

The
prospective
buyers
included
investor
Marvin
Davis
and
the
Toronto
Sun
.

The
death
of
the
Herald
,
a
newsstand
paper
in
a
freeway
town
,
was
perhaps
inevitable
.

Los
Angeles
is
a
sprawling
,
balkanized
newspaper
market
,
and
advertisers
seemed
to
feel
they
could
buy
space
in
the
mammoth
Times
,
then
target
a
particular
area
with
one
of
the
regional
dailies
.

The
Herald
was
left
in
limbo
.

Further
,
the
Herald
seemed
torn
editorially
between
keeping
its
old-time
Hearst
readership
--
blue-collar
and
sports-oriented
--
and
trying
to
provide
a
sprightly
,
upscale
alternative
to
the
sometimes
staid
Times
.

Hearst
had
flirted
with
a
conversion
to
tabloid
format
for
years
but
never
executed
the
plan
.

The
Herald
joins
the
Baltimore
News-American
,
which
folded
,
and
the
Boston
Herald-American
,
which
was
sold
,
as
cornerstones
of
the
old
Hearst
newspaper
empire
abandoned
by
the
company
in
the
1980s
.

Many
felt
Hearst
kept
the
paper
alive
as
long
as
it
did
,
if
marginally
,
because
of
its
place
in
family
history
.

Its
fanciful
offices
were
designed
by
architect
Julia
Morgan
,
who
built
the
Hearst
castle
at
San
Simeon
.

William
Randolph
Hearst
had
kept
an
apartment
in
the
Spanish
Renaissance-style
building
.

Analysts
said
the
Herald
's
demise
does
n't
necessarily
represent
the
overall
condition
of
the
newspaper
industry
.

``
The
Herald
was
a
survivor

``
Actually
,
the

Founded
as
the
Examiner
in
1903
by
Mr.
Hearst
,
the
Herald
was
crippled
by
a
bitter
,
decade-long
strike

that
began
in
1967
and
cut
circulation
in
half
.

Financially
,
it
never
recovered
;
editorially
,
it
had
its
moments
.

In
1979
,
Hearst
hired
editor
James
Bellows
,
who
brightened
the
editorial
product
considerably
.

He
and
his
successor
,
Mary
Anne
Dolan
,
restored
respect
for
the
editorial
product
,
and
though
in
recent
years

the
paper
had
been
limping
along
on
limited
resources
,
its
accomplishments
were
notable
.

For
example
,
the
Herald
consistently
beat
its
much-larger
rival
on
disclosures
about
Los
Angeles
Mayor
Tom
Bradley
's
financial
dealings
.

The
Herald
's
sports
coverage
and
arts
criticism
were
also
highly
regarded
.

Robert
J.
Danzig
,
vice
president
and
general
manager
of
Hearst
Newspapers
,
stood
up
in
the
paper
's
newsroom
yesterday
and
announced
that
no
buyers
had
stepped
forward
and
that
the
paper
would
fold
,
putting
more
than
730
full-time
employees
out
of
work
.

Hearst
said
it
would
provide
employees
with
a
placement
service
and
pay
them
for
60
days
.

Some
long-tenured
employees
will
receive
additional
benefits
,
the
company
said
.

Hours
after
the
announcement
,
representatives
of
the
Orange
County
Register
were
in
a
bar
across
the
street
recruiting
.

The
reaction
in
the
newsroom
was
emotional
.

``
I
've
never
seen
so
many
people
crying
in
one
place
at
one
time
,
''
said
Bill
Johnson
,
an
assistant
city
editor
.

``
So
Long
,
L.A.
''
was
chosen
as
the
paper
's
final
headline
.

``
I
'm
doing
the
main
story
,
and
I
'm
already
two
beers
drunk
,
''
said
reporter
Andy
Furillo
,
whom

the
Times
hired
away
several
years
ago
but
who
returned
to
the
Herald
out
of
preference
.

His
wife
also
works
for
the
paper
,
as
did
his
father
.

Outside
,
a
young
pressman
filling
a
news
box
with
an
extra
edition
headlined
``
Herald
Examiner
Closes
''
refused
to
take
a
reader
's
quarter
.

``
Forget
it

he
said
as
he
handed
her

a
paper
.

``
It
does
n't
make
any

Two
leading
constitutional-law
experts
said
President
Bush
does
n't
have
the
legal
authority
to
exercise
a
line-item
veto
.

Professors
Philip
Kurland
of
the
University
of
Chicago
and
Laurence
Tribe
of
Harvard
Law
School
said
any
effort
by
President
Bush
to
claim
authority
for
a
line-item
veto
would
contradict
the
text
of
the
Constitution
and
the
intent
of
its
authors
,
as
well
as
the
views
of
previous
presidents
.

A
line-item
veto
is
a
procedure

that
would
allow
a
president
to
veto
part
of
a
big
congressional
spending
bill
without
having
to
scuttle
the
entire
measure
.

Mr.
Bush
has
said
he
would
like
to
be
able
to
use
this
procedure
.

A
White
House
spokesman
said
last
week
that
the
president
is
considering
declaring
that
the
Constitution
implicitly
gives
him

the
authority
for
a
line-item
veto
to
provoke
a
test
case
.

But
the
two
legal
experts
,
responding
to
an
inquiry
by
Sen.
Edward
Kennedy
(
D.
,
Mass.
)
,
wrote
in
a
joint
letter
that
the
president
``
lacks
the
constitutional
authority
to
exercise
a
line-item
veto
.

''
The
two
professors
represent
different
ends
of
the
political
spectrum
--
Mr.
Kurland
is
a
conservative
and
Mr.
Tribe
is
a
liberal
.

The
two
professors
said
the
Constitution
authorizes
the
president
to
veto
entire
bills
,
not
partial
measures
.

Moreover
,
they
said
the
first
appropriations
bill
passed
200
years
ago
covered
many
different
items
,
and
there
was
no
discussion
of
a
line-item
veto
.

They
also
said
that
more
than
a
dozen
presidents
have
called
for
line-item
veto
authority
since
the
Civil
War
,
and
``
all
have
shared
the
view
that
such
lawmaking
power
is
beyond
the
reach
''
of
the
president
.

Sen.
Kennedy
said
in
a
separate
statement
that
he
supports
legislation
to
give
the
president
line-item
veto
power
,
but
that
it
would
be
a
``
reckless
course
of
action
''
for
President
Bush
to
claim
the
authority
without
congressional
approval
.

DSM
said
net
income
in
the
third
quarter
jumped
63
%
as
the
company
had
substantially
lower
extraordinary
charges
to
account
for
a
restructuring
program
.

The
Dutch
chemical
group
said
net
income
gained
to
235
million
guilders
(
$
113.2
million
)
,
or
6.70
guilders

a
share
,
from
144
million
guilders
,
or
4.10
guilders

a
share
,
a
year
ago
.

The
32
%
state-owned
DSM
had
eight
million
guilders
of
extraordinary
charges
in
the
latest
quarter
,
mainly
to
reflect
one-time
losses
in
connection
with
the
disposal
of
some
operations
.

The
charges
were
offset
in
part
by
a
gain
from
the
sale
of
the
company
's
construction
division
.

Last
year
,
DSM
had
71
million
guilders
of
extraordinary
charges
for
the
restructuring
program
and
other
transactions
.

The
earnings
growth
also
was
fueled
by
the
company
's
ability
to
cut
net
financing
spending
by
half
to
around
15
million
guilders
.

Also
,
substantially
lower
Dutch
corporate
tax
rates
helped
the
company
keep
its
tax
outlay
flat
relative
to
earnings
growth
,
the
company
added
.

Sales
,
however
,
were
little
changed
at
2.46
billion
guilders
,
compared
with
2.42
billion
guilders
.

Lewis
C.
Veraldi
,
the
father
of
the
team

that
created
the
highly
successful
Ford
Taurus
and
Mercury
Sable
cars
,
retired
early
after
experiencing
recent
heart
problems
.

Most
recently
,
Mr.
Veraldi
,
59
years
old
,
has
been
vice
president
of
product
and
manufacturing
engineering
at
Ford
Motor
Co
.

But
he
is
best
known
in
the
auto
industry
as
the
creator
of
a
team
car-development
approach

that
produced
the
two
midsized
cars

that
were
instrumental
in
helping
the
No.
2
auto
maker
record
profits
in
recent
years
and
in
enabling
the
company
's
Ford
division
to
eclipse
General
Motors
Corp.
's
Chevrolet
division
as
the
top-selling
nameplate
in
the
U.S
.

Under
the
so-called
Team
Taurus
approach
,
Mr.
Veraldi
and
other
Ford
product
planners
sought
the
involvement
of
parts
suppliers
,
assembly-line
workers
,
auto
designers
and
financial
staff
members
from
the
initial
stages
of
the
development
cycle
.

The
concept
's
goal
was
to
eliminate
bureaucracy
and
make
Ford
's
product
development
more
responsive
to
consumer
demands
.

It
was
later
applied
to
other
new-car
programs
,
including
those

that
produced
the
Ford
Thunderbird
and
Mercury
Cougar
.

Ford
Chairman
Donald
E.
Petersen
said
yesterday
that
Mr.
Veraldi
has
``
helped
to
change
the
world
's
perception
of
American-made
cars
.

Mr.
Veraldi
worked
at
Ford
for
40
years
,
holding
a
variety
of
car
and
parts-engineering
positions

Carnival
Cruise
Lines
Inc.
said
potential
problems
with
the
construction
of
two
big
cruise
ships
from
Finland
have
been
averted
.

Last
week
,
Miami-based
Carnival
disclosed
that
Waertsilae
Marine
Industries
,
the
Finnish
shipyard

that
is
building
Carnival
's
new
cruise
ships
,
planned
to
file
for
bankruptcy
.

Yesterday
,
Carnival
said
a
new
company
has
been
formed
in
Finland

that
will
carry
on
Waertsilae
's
shipbuilding
operations
.

Carnival
said
it
will
be
an
11
%
shareholder
in
the
new
company
.

Carnival
said
the
Fantasy
,
a
2,050-passenger
ship

that
was
slated
to
be
delivered
this
month
,
will
be
delivered
in
January
.

A
second
ship
is
now
expected
to
be
delivered
late
next
year
or
early
in
1991
.

Carnival
had
expected
that
ship
to
be
delivered
next
fall
.

A
planned
third
ship
still
may
be
built
in
the
Finnish
shipyard
,
or
may
be
built
elsewhere
,
Carnival
said
.

plans

Corp.
said
it
plans
to

most
of
its
psychiatric
and
drug
abuse
facilities
in
California
and
some
other
assets
to
pay
its
debt
and
provide
working
capital
.

In
all
,
the
company
hopes
to
repay
$
45
million
in
debt
through
the
sales
,
which
will
completely
discharge
its
secured
debt
,
the
company
said
.

In
addition
,
the
company
has
replaced
its
president
and
chief
executive
,
naming
W.
James
Nichol
,
head
of
the
company
's
contract
health
services
,
to
succeed
B.
Lee
Karns
.

Mr.
Nichol
said
he
was
``
extremely
disappointed
in
the
continuing
deterioration
of
the
company
's
operations
while
it
attempted
to
conclude
the
reorganization
during

four
months

Concurrent
with
Mr.

moved
its
corporate
headquarters
from

offices
.

Mr.

Rep.
John
Dingell
,
an
important
sponsor
of
President
Bush
's
clean-air
bill
,
plans
to
unveil
a
surprise
proposal

that
would
break
with
the
White
House
on
a
centerpiece
issue
:
acid
rain
.

The
Michigan
Democrat
's
proposal
,
which
is
expected
today
,
is
described
by
government
sources
and
lobbyists
as
significantly
weaker
than
the
Bush
administration
's
plan
to
cut
utility
emissions

that
lead
to
acid
rain
.

The
administration
's
plan
could
cost
utilities
,
mainly
those

that
use
coal
,
up
to
$
4
billion

a
year
.

The
proposal
comes
as
a
surprise
even
to
administration
officials
and
temporarily
throws
into
chaos

the
House
's
work
on
clean-air
legislation
.

As
chairman
of
the
House
Energy
and
Commerce
Committee
,
Mr.
Dingell
has
almost
single-handed
control
over
clean-air
legislation
.

People
close
to
the
utility
industry
said
Mr.
Dingell
's
proposal
appears
to
guarantee
only
an
estimated
seven-million-ton
cut
in
annual
sulfur-dioxide
emissions

that
lead
to
acid
rain
,
though
additional
cuts
could
be
ordered
later
.

Mr.
Bush
's
legislative
package
promises
to
cut
emissions
by
10
million
tons
--
basically
in
half
--
by
the
year
2000
.

Although
final
details
were
n't
available
,
sources
said
the
Dingell
plan
would
abandon
the
president
's
proposal
for
a
cap
on
utilities
'
sulfur-dioxide
emissions
.

That
proposal
had
been
hailed
by
environmentalists
but
despised
by
utilities
because
they
feared
it
would
limit
their
growth
.

It
also
would
junk
an
innovative
market-based
system
for
trading
emissions
credits
among
polluters
.

In
addition
,
it
is
believed
to
offer
a
cost-sharing
mechanism

that
would
help
subsidize
the
clean-up
costs
for
the
dirtiest
coal-fired
utilities
in
the
country
,
sparing
their
customers
from
exorbitant
jumps
in
their
electric
bills
.

The
administration
,
sticking
to
its
vow
of
avoiding
tax
increases
,
has
staunchly
opposed
cost-sharing
.

Mr.
Dingell
's
staff
was
expected
to
present
its
acid-rain
alternative
to
other
committee
members
,
apparently
in
an
attempt
to
appease
Midwestern
lawmakers
from
high-polluting
states

who
insist
on
cost-sharing
.

It
is
n't
clear
,
however
,
whether
support
for
the
proposal
will
be
broad
enough
to
pose
a
serious
challenge
to
the
White
House
's
acid-rain
plan
.

While
the
new
proposal
might
appeal
to
the
dirtiest
utilities
,
it
might
not
win
the
support
of
utilities
,
many
in
the
West
,
that
already
have
added
expensive
cleanup
equipment
or
burn
cleaner-burning
fuels
.

Lawmakers
representing
some
of
the
cleaner
utilities
have
been
quietly
working
with
the
White
House
to
devise
ways
to
tinker
with
the
administration
bill
to
address
their
acid-rain
concerns
.

The
U.S.
International
Trade
Commission
issued
preliminary
rulings
under
the
U.S.
anti-dumping
act
that
imports
of
sweaters
from
Hong
Kong
,
Taiwan
and
South
Korea
may
be
injuring
a
domestic
industry
.

Because
of
the
rulings
,
the
Commerce
Department
will
continue
to
investigate
complaints
by
U.S.
sweater
makers
that
the
imports
are
reaching
the
U.S.
at
unfairly
low
prices
in
violation
of
the
U.S.
anti-dumping
act
.

The
law
defines
unfairly
low
prices
as
ones
below
the
cost
of
production
or
below
prices
in
an
exporter
's
home
market
.

ITC
officials
said
final
Commerce
Department
and
ITC
rulings
wo
n't
come
until
next
March
or
later
.

If
both

agencies
find
violations
of
the
U.S.
trade
law
,
the
U.S.
would
assess
penalty
duties
on
the
imports
,
which
already
are
subject
to
import
quotas
under
bilateral
textile
and
apparel
trade
agreements
.

Imports
of
manmade-fiber
sweaters
in
1988
totaled
about
$
405
million
from
Taiwan
,
$
400
million
from
South
Korea
and
$
125
million
from
Hong
Kong
,
according
to
the
ITC
.

In
another
action
,
the
ITC
dismissed
anti-dumping
act
complaints
filed
by
Du
Pont
Co.
of
Wilmington
,
Del.
,
against
imports
of
neoprene
,
a
type
of
synthetic
rubber
,
from
France
and
West
Germany
.

These
imports
totaled
about
$
17
million
last
year
.

ECONOMIC

interest
rates

to
the
apparent

Despite
one
of
the
most
devastating
droughts
on
record
,
net
cash
income
in
the
Farm
Belt
rose
to
a
new
high
of
$
59.9
billion
last
year
.

The
previous
record
was
$
57.7
billion
in
1987
,
according
to
the
Agriculture
Department
.

Net
cash
income
--
the
amount
left
in
farmers
'
pockets
after
deducting
expenses
from
gross
cash
income
--
increased
in
33
states
in
1988
,
as
the
drought
cut
into
crop
yields
and
drove
up
commodity
prices
,
the
department
's
Economic
Research
Service
reported
yesterday
.

Most
of
those
states
set
farm
income
records
.

The
worst
crop
damage
occurred
in
the
Midwestern
Corn
Belt
and
the
northern
Great
Plains
.

What
saved
many
farmers
from
a
bad
year
was
the
opportunity
to
reclaim
large
quantities
of
grain
and
other
crops
that
they
had
``
mortgaged
''
to
the
government
under
price-support
loan
programs
.

With
prices
soaring
,
they
were
able
to
sell
the
reclaimed
commodities
at
``
considerable
profit
,
''
the
agency
's
240-page
report
said
.

In
less
parched
areas
,
meanwhile
,
farmers

who
had
little
or
no
loss
of
production
profited
greatly
from
the
higher
prices
.

To
the
surprise
of
some
analysts
,
net
cash
income
rose
in
some
of
the
hardest-hit
states
,
including
Indiana
,
Illinois
,
Nebraska
and
the
Dakotas
.

Analysts
attributed
the
increases
partly
to
the
$
4
billion
disaster-assistance
package
enacted
by
Congress
.

Last
year
's
record
net
cash
income
confirms
the
farm
sector
's
rebound
from
the
agricultural
depression
of
the
early
1980s
.

It
also
helps
explain
the
reluctance
of
the
major
farm
lobbies
and
many
lawmakers
to
make
any
significant
changes
in
the
1985
farm
program
next
year
.

Commodity
prices
have
been
rising
in
recent
years
,
with
the
farm
price
index
hitting
record
peaks
earlier
this
year
,
as
the
government
curtailed
production
with
land-idling
programs
to
reduce
price-depressing
surpluses
.

At
the
same
time
,
export
demand
for
U.S.
wheat
,
corn
and
other
commodities
strengthened
,
said
Keith
Collins
,
a
department
analyst
.

Farmers
also
benefited
from
strong
livestock
prices
,
as
the
nation
's
cattle
inventory
dropped
close
to
a
30-year
low
.

``
All
of
these
forces
came
together
in
1988
to
benefit
agriculture
,
''
Mr.
Collins
said
.

California
led
the
nation
with
$
6.5
billion
in
net
cash
income
last
year
,
followed
by
Texas
,
$
3.9
billion
;
Iowa
,
$
3.4
billion
;
Florida
,
$
3.1
billion
;
and
Minnesota
,
$
2.7
billion
.

Iowa
and
Minnesota
were
among
the
few
major
farm
states
to
log
a
decline
in
net
cash
income
.

Despite
federal
disaster
relief
,
the
drought
of
1988
was
a
severe
financial
setback
for
an
estimated
10,000
to
15,000
farmers
,
according
to
the
department
.

Many
lost
their
farms
.

Department
economists
do
n't
expect
1989
to
be
as
good
a
year
as
1988
was
.

Indeed
,
net
cash
income
is
likely
to
fall
this
year
as
farm
expenses
rise
and
government
payments
to
farmers
decline
.

At
the
same
time
,
an
increase
of
land
under
cultivation
after
the
drought
has
boosted
production
of
corn
,
soybeans
and
other
commodities
,
causing
a
fall
in
prices

that
has
been
only
partly
cushioned
by
heavy
grain
buying
by
the
Soviets
.

Last
year
,
government
payments
to
farmers
slipped
to
less
than
$
14.5
billion
from
a
record
$
16.7
billion
in
1987
.

Payments
are
expected
to
range
between
$
9
billion
and
$
12
billion
this
year
.

Metallgesellschaft

a

West

group
,
said
it
is
buying

to
expand
its
production
of
environmental
supplies
for
power
plants
.

the

.

The
move
is
part
of
a
strategy
to
focus
on
its
core
metals
trading
,
processing
and
plant
engineering
activities
while
shedding
peripheral
units
,
the
company
said
.

Lentjes
had
1988
sales
of
800
million
marks
(
$
434.4
million
)
and
has
a
current

of
2.5
billion
marks
.

The
sale
comes
in
place
of
a
planned
initial
public
offering
of
Lentjes
stock
.

A
plan
to
bring
the
stock
to
market
before
year
end
apparently
was
upset
by
the
recent
weakness
of
Frankfurt
share
prices

of

Ltd
.

The
department
said
it
referred
the

to
the

and
Mergers
Commission
because
of
the
purchase
's
possible
effects
on
the
U.K.
market
for

.

BTR

it

Michelin
officials
could

immediately
comment
on

,
but
they
noted
the
purchase
from
BTR
has
already
been
concluded
.

47
%
decline
in
fourth-quarter
earnings
,
reflecting
restructuring
costs

well

market
.

The

.

For
the

ended
Sept.

,
Ralston
earned
$
422.5

,
or
$
6.44

a
share
,
up
8.9
%
from
$
387.8

,
or

.

This
year
's
results
included
a
gain
of

.

Sales
for
the
full
year
were
$
6.6
billion
,
up
13
%
from
$
5.8
billion
.

Ralston
said
its
restructuring
costs
include
the
phase-out
of
a
battery
facility
in
Greenville
,
N.C.
,
the
recent
closing
of
a
Hostess
cake
bakery
in

and
a
reduction
in
staff
throughout
the
company
.

The
battery
plant
,
which
makes
rechargeable
nickel
cadmium
and
carbon
zinc
products
,
will
be
closed
over
the
next
year
or
so
,
a
spokesman
said
.

Ralston
attributed
its
fourth-quarter
slump
partly
to
higher
costs
of
ingredients
in
the
pet
food
business
as
well
as
competitive
pressures
,
which
required
higher
advertising
spending
.

For
the
year
,
pet
food
volume
was
flat
,
the
company
said
.

Its
cereal
division
realized
higher
operating
profit
on
volume
increases
,
but
also
spent
more
on
promotion
.

The
Continental
Baking
business
benefited
from
higher
margins
on
bread
and
on
increased
cake
sales
,
it
added
.

Ralston
said
its

``
Feeding
Frenzy
''
(
Henry
Holt
,
326
pages

$
19.95
)
,
a
highly
detailed
account
of
the
Wedtech
scandal
,
begins
on
a
reassuring
note
.

Right
up
front
in
the
preface
,
co-author
William
Sternberg
gives
us

an
example
of
his
own
integrity
.

When
offered
a
free
trip
from
the
Bronx
,
Wedtech
's
home
,
to
Washington
,
D.C.
,
by
one
of
Wedtech
's
principals
,
he
tells
the
reader
,
``
mindful
of
accepting
anything
of
value
from
those

I
was
writing
about
,
I
declined
.

''

Any
question
as
to
why
an
author
would
believe
this
plaintive
,
high-minded
note
of
assurance
is
necessary
is
answered
by
reading
this
book
about
sticky
fingers
and
sweaty
scammers
.

Bribe
by
bribe
,
Mr.
Sternberg
and
his
co-author
,
Matthew
C.
Harrison
Jr.
,
lead
us
along
the
path
Wedtech
traveled
,
from
its
inception
as
a
small
manufacturing
company
to
the
status
of
full-fledged
defense
contractor
,
entrusted
with
the
task
of
producing
vital
equipment
for
the
Army
and
Navy
.

The
book
revolves
around
John
Mariotta
,
the
founder
of
the
company
,
and
Fred
Neuberger
,
who
became
his
partner
soon
after
Wedtech
's
creation
.

Although
started
in
1965
,
Wedtech
did
n't
really
get
rolling
until
1975
,
when
Mr.
Neuberger
discovered
the
federal
government
's
Section
8
(
A
)
minority
business
program
.

This
is
a
Johnson-era
,
Great
Society
creation

that
mandates
certain
government
contracts
be
awarded
noncompetitively
to
minority
businesses
.

Mr.
Neuberger
realized
that
,
although
of
Italian
ancestry
,
Mr.
Mariotta
still
could
qualify
as
a
minority
person
since
he
was
born
in
Puerto
Rico
.

The
two
partners
merely
had
to
falsify
the
true
ownership
of
the
corporation
.

Instead
of
it
became
,
on
paper
only
,
two-thirds
Mariotta
,
one-third
Neuberger
,
and
they
were
in
the
program
and
off
to
the
races
.

Besides
being
a
``
minority-owned
company
''
Wedtech
was
located
in
the
South
Bronx
,
a
blighted
area
,
made
famous
by
Jimmy
Carter
in
his
1976
presidential
campaign
.

The
company
plugged
itself
right
into
Carter
campaign
rhetoric
about
rebuilding
the
South
Bronx
and
kept
using
the
minority
--
South
Bronx
angle
through
the
Reagan
'80s
.

Starting
with
Congressman
Mario
Biaggi
(
now
serving
a
jail
sentence
)
,
the
company
began
a
career
of
bribing
federal
,
state
and
local
public
officials
and
those
close
to
public
officials
,
right
up
to
and
including
E.
Robert
Wallach
,
close
friend
and
adviser
to
former
Attorney
General
Ed
Meese
.

Wedtech
did
n't
just
use
old
fashioned
bribery
.

It
made
ample
use
of
the
modern
techniques
of
influence
peddling
,
retaining
politically
connected
``
respectable
''
law
firms
,
investment
bankers
and
political
consultants
,
including
Reagan
confidant
Lyn
Nofzinger
.

When
necessary
,
it
sought
and
received
assistance
from
organized
crime
.

Sometimes
the
bribed
became
partners
in
the
company
.

Wedtech
management
used
the
merit
system
.

If
you
were
especially
helpful
in
a
corrupt
scheme

you
received
not
just
cash
in
a
bag
,
but
equity
.

If
you
were
not
an
effective
crook
,
you
found
yourself
out
in
the
cold
,
a
fate

that
eventually
befell
Mr.
Mariotta
,
the
firm
's
semiliterate
``
minority
''
person
.

But
despite
the
sensational
nature
of
the
revelations
and
the
breezy
,
easy-to-read
tabloid
writing
style
,
``
Feeding
Frenzy
''
often
falls
short
of
gripping
reading
.

None
of
the
scams
show
much
ingenuity
:
Auditors
found
crookery

the
first
day
on
the
job
.

Wedtech
's
scammers
simply
bribed
them
to
shut
up
.

The
scammers
themselves
were
garden-variety
low
lifes
,
conspicuous
consumers

who
wanted
big
houses
,
Mercedes
cars
,
beautiful
women
,
expensive
clothes
.

Among
the
lot
of
them
,
not
one
is
wrestling
with
good
and
evil
,
or
especially
intelligent
or
even
temporarily
insane
.

The
one
character
at
least

somewhat
interesting
was
Irving
Louis
Lobsenz
,
a
pediatrician

who
changed
his
name
to
Rusty
Kent
London
and
became
a
master
gambler
and
author
of
a
book
on
blackjack
.

He
enters
the
story
toward
the
end
,
just
in
time
to
get
arrested
.

Absorbed
in
doling
out
``
Feeding
Frenzy
's
''
tidbits
,
the
authors
gloss
over
the
root
causes
of
Wedtech
,
namely
the
Section
8
(
A
)
federal
program
under
whose
auspices

the
scandal
took
place
.

They
do
at
least
come
around
to
saying
that
the
courts
might
want
to
end
``
rigid
affirmative
action
programs
.

''
Programs
like
Section
8
(
A
)
are
a
little
like
leaving
gold
in
the
street
and
then
expressing
surprise
when
thieves
walk
by
to
scoop
it
up
.

Numerous
other
scandals
,
among
them

the
ones
at
HUD
,
have
the
same
characteristics
as
Wedtech
.

They
take
place
in
government
programs

that
seem
tailor-made
for
corruption
.

Why
are
programs
like
this
not
eliminated
?

``
Feeding
Frenzy
''
does
provide
a
few
clues
.

In
and
around
all
levels
of
government
in
the
U.S.
are
groups
of
people

who
can
best
be
described
as
belonging
to
a
political
insider
commercial
party
.

They
know
that
whenever
government
is
redistributing
wealth
,
regulating
commerce
or
maintaining
a
large
defense
establishment
,
there
is
big
money
to
be
made
in
influencing
,
brokering
or
selling
the
processes
and
decisions
of
government
.

They
are
our
version
of
the
East
bloc
's
Nomenklatura
and
they
have
absolutely
no
wish
to
see
anything
change
.

How
many
government
programs
and
policies
exist
because
they
line
the
pockets
of
political
insiders
?

This
is
the
real
issue
raised
by
the
Wedtech
scandal
.

Mr.
Stern
was
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
New
York
State
Urban
Development
Corp.
,
1983-85
.

Robert
L.
Bernstein
,
chairman
and
president
of
Random
House
Inc.
,
announced
his
resignation
from
the
publishing
house

he
has
run
for
23
years
.

A
successor
was
n't
named
,
which
fueled
speculation
that
Mr.
Bernstein
may
have
clashed
with
S.I.
Newhouse
Jr.
,
whose
family
company
,
Advance
Publications
Inc.
,
owns
Random
House
.

Abrupt
departures
are
n't
unheard
of
within
the
Newhouse
empire
.

In
an
interview
,
Mr.
Bernstein
said
his
departure
``
evolved
out
of
discussions
with
Si
Newhouse
and
that
's
the
decision

I
reached
.

''
He
declined
to
elaborate
,
other
than
to
say
,
``
It
just
seemed
the
right
thing
to
do
at
this
minute
.

Sometimes
you
just
go
with
your
gut
.

''
Mr.
Bernstein
said
he
will
stay
until
Dec.
31
and
work
with
his
successor
,
who
is
to
be
named
soon
.

Mr.
Newhouse
,
meanwhile
,
insisted
that
he
is
n't
unhappy
with
Mr.
Bernstein
or
the
performance
of
Random
House
,
the
largest
trade
publishing
house
in
the
U.S
.

The
company
said
the
publisher
's
annual
sales
volume
increased
to
$
800
million
from
$
40
million
during
Mr.
Bernstein
's
tenure
.

``
Bob
has
handled
the
extraordinary
growth
of
the
company
quite
brilliantly
,
''
said
Mr.
Newhouse
.

``
The
company
is
doing
well
,
it
's
stable
,
it
's
got
good
people
.

Bob
has
an
agenda
and
this
seemed
like
the
natural
time
.

''

Publishing
officials
believe
that
while
Random
House
has
enjoyed
spectacular
growth
and
has
smoothly
integrated
many
acquisitions
in
recent
years
,
some
of
the
bigger
ones
have
n't
been
absorbed
so
easily
.

Crown
Publishing
Group
,
acquired
last
year
,
is
said
to
be
turning
in
disappointing
results
.

As
a
private
company
,
Random
House
does
n't
report
its
earnings
.

Mr.
Bernstein
,
who
succeeded
Bennett
Cerf
,
has
been
only
the
second
president
of
Random
House
since
it
was
founded
in
1925
.

Speculation
on
his
successor
centers
on
a
number
of
division
heads
at
the
house
.

Possible
candidates
include
Susan
Petersen
,
president
of
,
Random
House
's
huge
and
successful
paperback
division
.

Some
say
Anthony
Cheetham
,
head
of
a
recently
acquired
British
company
,
Century
Hutchinson
,
could
be
chosen
.

There
is
also
speculation
that
Mr.
Newhouse
could
bring
in
a
powerhouse
businessman
or
another
Newhouse
family
member
to
run
the
business
side
,
in
combination
with
a
publishing
executive
like
Robert
Gottlieb
,
who
left
Random
House
's
Alfred
A.
Knopf
to
run
the
New
Yorker
,
also
owned
by
the
Newhouse
family
.

Not
included
on
the
most-likely-successor
list
are
Joni
Evans
,
recruited
two
years
ago
to
be
publisher
of
adult
trade
books
for
Random
House
,
and
Sonny
Mehta
,
president
of
the
prestigious
Alfred
A.
Knopf
unit
.

When
Ms.
Evans
took
her

job
,
several
important
divisions

that
had
reported
to
her
predecessor
were
n't
included
partly
because
she
did
n't
wish
to
be
a
full-time
administrator
.

Mr.
Mehta
is
widely
viewed
as
a
brilliant
editor
but
a
less-than-brilliant
administrator
and
his
own
departure
was
rumored
recently
.

Mr.
Bernstein
,
a
tall
,
energetic
man

who
is
widely
respected
as
a
publishing
executive
,
has
spent
much
of
his
time
in
recent
years
on
human
rights
issues
.

Sony
Corp.
completed
its
tender
offer
for
Columbia
Pictures
Entertainment
Inc.
,
with
Columbia
shareholders
tendering
99.3
%
of
all
common
shares
outstanding
by
the
Tuesday
deadline
.

Sony
Columbia
Acquisition
Corp.
,
formed
for
the
Columbia
deal
,
will
formally
take
ownership
of
the
movie
studio
later
this
month
,
a
spokesman
said
.

Sony
is
paying
$
27

a
share
,
or
$
3.55
billion
,
cash
and
is
assuming
$
1.4
billion
of
long-term
debt
.

Still
unresolved
is
Sony
's
effort
to
hire
producers
Jon
Peters
and
Peter
Guber
to
run
the
studio
.

Sony
's
planned
acquisition
of
Entertainment
Co.
for
$
200
million
is
scheduled
to
close
Monday
.

has
been
locked
in
litigation
with
Warner
Communications
Inc.
in
an
attempt
to
get
out
of
an
exclusive
production
contract
with
Warner
.

Both

sides
are
in
talks
to
settle
the
dispute
.

Congress
learned
during
the
Reagan
administration
that
it
could
intimidate
the
executive
branch
by
uttering
again
and
again
the
same
seven
words
:
``
Provided
,
that
no
funds
shall
be
spent
...
.

''
This
phrase
once
again
is
found
throughout
the
many
appropriations
bills
now
moving
through
Congress
.

It
signals
Congress
's
attempt
,
under
the
pretext
of
guarding
the
public
purse
,
to
deny
the
president

the
funding
necessary
to
execute
certain
of
his
duties
and
prerogatives
specified
in
Article
II
of
the
Constitution
.

This
species
of
congressional
action
is
predicated
on
an
interpretation
of
the
appropriations
clause

that
is
erroneous
and
unconstitutional
.

The
appropriations
clause
states
that
``
No
Money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
Treasury
,
but
in
Consequence
of
Appropriations
made
by
Law
...
.

''
The
prevailing
interpretation
of
the
clause
on
Capitol
Hill
is
that
it
gives
Congress

an
omnipresent
veto
over
every
conceivable
action
of
the
president
through
the
ability
to
withhold
funding
.

This
interpretation
was
officially
endorsed
by
Congress
in
1987
in
the
Iran-Contra
Report
.

As
partisans
of
congressional
power
understand
,
a
``
power
of
the
purse
''
so
broadly
construed
would
emasculate
the
presidency
and
swallow
the
principle
of
separation
of
powers
.

It
is
not
supported
by
the
text
or
history
of
the
Constitution
.

The
framers
hardly
discussed
the
appropriations
clause
at
the
Constitutional
Convention
of
1787
,
according
to
Madison
's
notes
.

To
the
extent

they
did
,
their
concern
was
to
ensure
fiscal
accountability
.

Moreover
,
the
framers
believed
that
the
nation
needed
a
unitary
executive
with
the
independence
and
resources
to
perform
the
executive
functions
that
the
Confederation
Congress
had
performed
poorly
under
the
Articles
of
Confederation
.

It
would
contradict
that
objective
if
the
appropriations
clause
(
technically
a
limitation
on
legislative
power
)
could
be
read
as
placing
the
president
on
Congress
's
short
leash
,
making
the
executive
consist
of
the
president
and
every
member
of
Congress
.

As
it
went
to
the
conference
panel
now
deliberating
,
the
appropriations
bill
for
the
executive
office
of
the
president
for
fiscal
1990
contained
some
breathtaking
attempts
by
Congress
to
rewrite
the
Constitution
under
the
pretext
of
protecting
the
public
's
money
.

During
the
coming
weeks
,
President
Bush
must
decide
whether
to
veto
the
bills
containing
them
--
or
,
alternatively
,
to
sign
these
bills
into
law
with
a
statement
declaring
their
intrusions
on
executive
power
to
be
in
violation
of
Article
II
,
and
thus
void
and
severable
.

The
1990
appropriations
legislation
attempts
to
strip
the
president
of
his
powers
to
make
certain
appointments
as
provided
by
Article
II
.

Article
II
places
on
the
president

the
duty
to
nominate
,
``
and
by
and
with
the
Advice
and
Consent
of
the
Senate
''
appoint
,
ambassadors
,
judges
,
and
other
officers
of
the
U.S
.

It
also
empowers
the
president
to
make
recess
appointments
,
without
Senate
approval
:
``
The
President
shall
have
Power
to
fill
up
all
Vacancies

that
may
happen
during
the
Recess
of
the
Senate
,
by
granting
Commissions

which
shall
expire
at
the
End
of
their
next
Session
.

''

Yet
Section
605
of
the
appropriations
bill
for
the
executive
office
provides
:
``
No
part
of
any
appropriation
for
the
current
fiscal
year
contained
in
this
or
any
other
Act
shall
be
paid
to
any
person
for
the
filling
of
any
position
for
which

he
or
she
has
been
nominated
after
the
Senate
has
voted
not
to
approve
the
nomination
of
said
person
.

''
Thus
,
with
one
brief
passage
in
an
appropriations
bill
,
Congress
repeals

the
president
's
power
to
make
recess
appointments
under
Article
II
.

Section
605
also
imposes
unconstitutional
conditions
on
the
president
's
ability
to
nominate
candidates
of
his
choosing
.

The
language
of
the
appropriations
rider
implies
that
any
nomination
to
any
position
of
a
rejected
nominee
will
result
in
the
president
being
denied
funding
to
pay
that
person
's
salary
.

The
president
could
probably
not
avoid
this
restriction
by
choosing
people
willing
to
serve
without
pay
,
because
the
Anti-Deficiency
Act
prohibits
voluntary
service
to
the
government
.

The
1990
appropriations
bills
also
contain
a
number
of
``
muzzling
''
provisions

that
violate
the
recommendation
clause
in
Article
II
of
the
Constitution
.

Muzzling
provisions
,
which
might
be
called
``
blindfold
laws
''
as
well
,
prevent
the
executive
branch
from
even
looking
at
certain
policy
options
,
let
alone
from
recommending
them
to
Congress
.

Such
laws
violate
the
provision
in
Article
II

that
requires
the
president
to
make
recommendations
to
Congress
,
but
which
gives
the
president

the
discretion
to
select
the
subject
matter
of
those
recommendations
.

Typically
,
these
laws
seek
to
prevent
executive
branch
officials
from
inquiring
into
whether
certain
federal
programs
make
any
economic
sense
or
proposing
more
market-oriented
alternatives
to
regulations
.

Probably
the
most
egregious
example
is
a
proviso
in
the
appropriations
bill
for
the
executive
office

that
prevents
the
president
's
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
from
subjecting
agricultural
marketing
orders
to
any
cost-benefit
scrutiny
.

There
is
something
inherently
suspect
about
Congress
's
prohibiting
the
executive
from
even
studying
whether
public
funds
are
being
wasted
in
some
favored
program
or
other
.

Perhaps
none
of
the
unconstitutional
conditions
contained
in
the
appropriations
bills
for
fiscal
1990
better
illustrates
Congress
's
attempt
to
usurp
executive
power
than
Section
609
of
the
executive-office
bill
:
``
None
of
the
funds
made
available
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
this
Act
shall
be
used
to
implement
,
administer
,
or
enforce
any
regulation

which
has
been
disapproved
pursuant
to
a
resolution
of
disapproval
duly
adopted
in
accordance
with
the
applicable
law
of
the
United
States
.

''

This
provision
amounts
to
a
legislative
veto
over
the
president
's
execution
of
the
law
,
since
a
one-house
resolution
could
be
said
to
be
``
duly
adopted
''
even
though
it
would
require
neither
bicameral
action
in
Congress
nor
presentation
to
the
president
for
his
signature
or
veto
.

The
Supreme
Court
's
decision
in
INS
v.
Chadha
held
that
legislative
vetoes
are
unconstitutional
.

President
Bush
should
veto
appropriations
acts

that
contain
these
kinds
of
unconstitutional
conditions
on
the
president
's
ability
to
discharge
his
duties
and
exercise
his
prerogatives
.

If
President
Bush
fails
to
do
so
in
his
first
year
,
he
will
invite
Congress
,
for
the
remainder
of
his
presidency
,
to
rewrite
Article
II
of
the
Constitution
to
suit
its
purposes
.

What
becomes
custom
in
the
Bush
administration
will
only
become
more
difficult
for
future
presidents
,
including
Democrats
,
to
undo
.

President
Reagan
learned
that
lesson
.

By
1987
,
then-Speaker
Jim
Wright
was
discussing
arms
control
in
Moscow
with
Mikhail
Gorbachev
and
then
attempting
to
direct
the
president
,
through
an
appropriations
rider
,
to
treat
the
Soviets
as
though
the
Senate
had
ratified
SALT
II
.

If
a
veto
is
unworkable
because
it
would
leave
part
of
the
executive
branch
unfunded
,
the
president
could
sign
the
appropriations
bills
into
law
and
assert
a
power
of
excision
,
declaring
the
rider
restricting
his
Article
II
powers
to
be
unconstitutional
and
severable
.

The
Constitution
does
not
expressly
give
the
president
such
power
.

However
,
the
president
does
have
a
duty
not
to
violate
the
Constitution
.

The
question
is
whether
his
only
means
of
defense
is
the
veto
.

Excision
of
appropriations
riders

that
trespass
on
the
president
's
duties
and
prerogative
under
Article
II
would
be
different
from
the
line-item
veto
.

As
discussed
in
the
context
of
controlling
federal
spending
,
the
line-item
veto
is
characterized
as
a
way
for
the
president
to
excise
perfectly
constitutional
provisions
in
a
spending
bill

that
are
objectionable
merely
because
they
conflict
with
his
policy
objectives
.

The
excision
of
unconstitutional
conditions
in
an
appropriations
bill
would
be
a
power
of
far
more
limited
applicability
.

One
could
argue
that
it
is
not
an
assertion
of
a
item
veto
at
all
for
the
president
,
by
exerting
a
power
of
excision
,
to
resist
unconstitutional
conditions
in
legislation

that
violate
the
separation
of
powers
.

There
is
no
downside
if
the
president
asserts
a
right
of
excision
over
unconstitutional
conditions
in
the
fiscal
1990
appropriations
bills
.

If
Congress
does
nothing
,
President
Bush
will
have
won
.

If
Congress
takes
the
dispute
to
the
Supreme
Court
(
assuming
it
can
establish
standing
to
sue
)
,
President
Bush
might
win
.

In
that
case
,
he
might
receive
an
opinion
from
the
court

that
is
a
vindication
of
the
president
's
right
to
perform
the
duties
and
exercise
the
prerogatives

the
framers
thought
should
be
entrusted
to
the
executive
.

If
President
Bush
loses
at
the
court
,
it
might
be
disappointing
,
as
Morrison
v.
Olson
was
for
the
Reagan
administration
.

But
the
presidency
would
be
no
worse
off
than
it
is
now
.

Moreover
,
the
electorate
would
have
received
a
valuable
civics
lesson
in
how
the
separation
of
powers
works
in
practice
.

As
it
stands
now
,
Congress
presumes
after
the
Reagan
administration
that
the
White
House
will
take
unconstitutional
provisions
in
appropriations
bills
lying
down
.

President
Bush
should
set
things
straight
.

If
he
does
not
,
he
will
help
realize
Madison
's
fear
in
The
Federalist
No.
48

Beauty
Takes
Backseat

To
Safety
on
Bridges

EVERYONE
AGREES
that
most
of
the
nation
's
old
bridges
need
to
be
repaired
or
replaced
.

But
there
's
disagreement
over
how
to
do
it
.

Highway
officials
insist
the
ornamental
railings
on
older
bridges
are
n't
strong
enough
to
prevent
vehicles
from
crashing
through
.

But
other
people
do
n't
want
to
lose
the
bridges
'
beautiful
,
sometimes
historic
,
features
.

``
The
primary
purpose
of
a
railing
is
to
contain
a
vehicle
and
not
to
provide
a
scenic
view
,
''
says
Jack
White
,
a
planner
with
the
Indiana
Highway
Department
.

He
and
others
prefer
to
install
railings
such
as
the
``
type
F
safety
shape
,
''
a
four-foot-high
concrete
slab
with
no
openings
.

In
Richmond
,
Ind.
,
the
type
F
railing
is
being
used
to
replace
arched
openings
on
the
G
Street
Bridge
.

Garret
Boone
,
who
teaches
art
at
Earlham
College
,
calls
the
new
structure
``
just
an
ugly
bridge
''
and
one

that
blocks
the
view
of
a
new
park
below
.

In
Hartford
,
Conn.
,
the
Charter
Oak
Bridge
will
soon
be
replaced
,
the
cast-iron
medallions
from
its
railings
relegated
to
a
park
.

Compromises
are
possible
.

Citizens
in
Peninsula
,
Ohio
,
upset
over
changes
to
a
bridge
,
negotiated
a
deal
:
The
bottom
half
of
the
railing
will
be
type
F
,
while
the
top
half
will
have
the
old
bridge
's
floral
pattern
.

Similarly
,
highway
engineers
agreed
to
keep
the
old
railings
on
the
Key
Bridge
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
as
long
as
they
could
install
a
crash
barrier
between
the
sidewalk
and
the
road
.

PORTING
POTABLES
just
got
easier
,
or
so
claims
Scypher
Corp.
,
the
maker
of
the
Cup-Tote
.

The
Chicago
company
's
beverage
carrier
,
meant
to
replace
cardboard
trays
at
concession
stands
and
fast-food
outlets
,
resembles
the
plastic
loops
used
on
six-packs
of
beer
,
only
the
loops
hang
from
a
web
of
strings
.

The
new
carrier
can
tote
as
many
as
four
cups
at
once
.

Inventor
Claire
Marvin
says
his
design
virtually
eliminates
spilling
.

Lids
are
n't
even
needed
.

He
also
claims
the
carrier
costs
less
and
takes
up
less
space
than
most
paper
carriers
.

A
few
fast-food
outlets
are
giving
it

a
try
.

The
company
acknowledges
some
problems
.

A
driver
has
to
find
something
to
hang
the
carrier
on
,
so
the
company
supplies
a
window
hook
.

While
it
breaks
down
in
prolonged
sunlight
,
it
is
n't
recyclable
.

And
unlike
some
trays
,
there
's
no
place
for
food
.

Spirit
of
Perestroika

Touches
Design
World

AN
EXCHANGE
of
U.S.
and
Soviet
designers
promises
change
on
both

sides
.

An
exhibition
of
American
design
and
architecture
opened
in
September
in
Moscow
and
will
travel
to
eight
other
Soviet
cities
.

The
show
runs
the
gamut
,
from
a
blender
to
chairs
to
a
model
of
the
Citicorp
building
.

The
event
continues
into
next
year
and
includes
an
exchange
program
to
swap
design
teachers
at
Carnegie-Mellon
and
Leningrad
's
Mutchin
Institute
.

Dan
Droz
,
leader
of
the
Carnegie-Mellon
group
,
sees
benefits
all
around
.

The
Soviets
,
who
normally
have
few
clients
other
than
the
state
,
will
get
``
exposure
to
a
market
system
,
''
he
says
.

Americans
will
learn
more
about
making
products
for
the
Soviets
.

Mr.
Droz
says
the
Soviets
could
even
help
U.S.
designers
renew
their
sense
of
purpose
.

``
In
Moscow
,
they
kept
asking
us
things
like
,
`
Why
do
you
make
15
different
corkscrews
,
when
all

you
need
is
one

good
one
?

'
''
he
says
.

``
They
got
us
thinking
maybe
we
should
be
helping
U.S.
companies
improve
existing
products
rather
than
always
developing
new
ones

Seed
for
Jail
Solution

Fails
to
Take
Root

IT
'S
A
TWO
BIRDS
with
one
stone
deal
:
Eggers
Group
architects
propose
using
grain
elevators
to
house
prisoners
.

It
would
ease
jail
overcrowding
while
preserving
historic
structures
,
the
company
says
.

But
New
York
state
,
which
is
seeking
solutions
to
its
prison
cell
shortage
,
says
``
no
.

''

Grain
elevators
built
in
the
1920s
and
'30s
have
six-inch
concrete
walls
and
a
tubular
shape

that
would
easily
contain
semicircular
cells
with
a
control
point
in
the
middle
,
the
New
York
firm
says
.

Many
are
far
enough
from
residential
areas
to
pass
public
muster
,
yet
close
enough
to
permit
family
visits
.

Besides
,
Eggers
says
,
grain
elevators
are
worth
preserving
for
aesthetic
reasons
--
one
famed
architect
compared
them
to
the
pyramids
of
Egypt
.

A
number
of
cities
--
including
Minneapolis
,
Philadelphia
and
Houston
--
have
vacant
grain
elevators
,
Eggers
says
.

A
medium-sized
one
in
Brooklyn
,
it
says
,
could
be
altered
to
house
up
to
1,000
inmates
at
a
lower
cost
than
building
a
new
prison
in
upstate
New
York
.

A
spokesman
for
the
state
,
however
,
calls
the
idea
``
not
effective

efficient

Freeport-McMoRan

partnership

said
the

adverse

otherwise
,
on

Freeport-McMoRan

the

will
exchange
its

Freeport-McMoRan
Energy

additional
55
cents-a-unit
distribution
payments
before
the
trust
is
liquidated
in

the

It

expected
that

equal
to

about
108

ORTEGA
ENDED

a
truce
with
the
Contras
and
said
elections
were
threatened
.

The
Nicaraguan
president
,
citing
attacks
by
the
U.S.-backed
rebels
,
suspended
a
19-month-old
cease-fire
and
accused
Bush
of
``
promoting
death
.

''
While
he
reaffirmed
support
for
the
country
's
Feb.
25
elections
,
Ortega
indicated
that
renewed
U.S.
military
aid
to
the
Contras
could
thwart
the
balloting
.

He
said
U.S.
assistance
should
be
used
to
demobilize
the
rebels
.

A
White
House
spokesman
condemned
the
truce
suspension
as
``
deplorable
''
but
brushed
off
talk
of
renewing
military
funding
for
the
insurgents
.

The
Contra

command
,
in
a
statement
from
Honduras
,
said
Sandinista
troops
had
launched
a
major
offensive

East
German
leader

called
the
protests
in
his
country

a
``

,
''
saying
that
many
of

marching
for
democratic
freedoms

support
for
``
the
renovation

''
The
Communist

chief
,
in

Standard
&
Poor
's
Corp.
lowered
to
double-C
from
triple-C

the
rating
on
about
$
130
million
of
debt
.

The
rating
concern
said
the
textile
and
clothing
company
's
interest
expense
exceeds
operating
profit
``
by
a
wide
margin
''
and
it
noted
United
's
estimated
after-tax
loss
of
$
24
million
for
the
year
ended
June
30
.

USX
Corp.
posted
a
23
%
drop
in
third-quarter
profit
,
as
improved
oil
results
failed
to
offset
weakness
in
steel
and
natural
gas
operations
.

The
nation
's
largest
steelmaker
earned
$
175
million
,
or
62
cents

a
share
,
compared
with
the
year-earlier
$
228
million
,
or
80
cents

a
share
.

The
recent
quarter
includes
pretax
gains
of
$
98
million
from
asset
sales
,
while
like
gains
in
the
year-earlier
quarter
totaled
$
61
million
.

In
the
1988
period
,
USX
also
had
a
$
71
million
after-tax
gain
from
a
tax
dispute
settlement
.

Sales
rose
5
%
to
$
4.4
billion
from
$
4.2
billion
.

The
earnings
drop
appears
particularly
steep
in
comparison
with
last
year
's
unusually
strong
third
quarter
,
when
the
company
was
riding
an
industrywide
boom
in
demand
and
pricing
.

However
,
third-quarter
operating
profit
fell
14
%
,
as
USX
sold
sizable
chunks
of
its
diversified
and
steel
segments
,
eliminating
income
from
those
operations
.

Among
segments

that
continue
to
operate
,
though
,
the
company
's
steel
division
continued
to
suffer
from
soft
demand
for
its
tubular
goods
serving
the
oil
industry
and
other
markets
.

Peter
Marcus
,
an
analyst
with
PaineWebber
Inc.
,
said
that
a
downturn
in
the
appliance
industry
,
coupled
with
sluggish
automotive
sales
,
hurt
USX
results
.

Moreover
,
USX
exports
more
than
other
steelmakers
,
and
the
overseas
market
has
been
under
more
severe
pricing
pressure
.

The
company
attributed
lower
sales
and
earnings
for
the
steel
segment
to
the
loss
of
results
from
the
Lorain
,
Ohio
,
plant
,
which
now
is
a
50-50
joint
venture
with
Japan
's
Kobe
Steel
Ltd
.

In
the
steel
division
,
operating
profit
dropped
11
%
to
$
85
million
.

Profit
per
ton
of
steel
shipped
dropped
to
about
$
33

a
ton
from
$
42

a
ton
last
year
and
$
53

a
ton
in
the
second
quarter
,
analysts
said
.

Still
,
USX
fared
better
than
other
major
steelmakers
,
earning
more
per
ton
of
steel
shipped
than
either
Bethlehem
Steel
Corp.
,
which
posted
a
54
%
drop
in
net
income
,
or
Inland
Steel
Industries
Inc.
,
whose
profit
plummeted
70
%
.

In
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
yesterday
,
USX
shares
closed
up
$
1.25
,
at
$
34.625
,
as
the
reported
earnings
exceeded
projections
by
some
analysts

who
had
n't
expected
as
great
a
volume
of
asset
sales
.

The
rise
in
the
stock
's
price
may
also
reflect
the
fact
that
USX
's
steel
segment
fared
better
than
some
other
steelmakers
'
.

Charles
Bradford
,
an
analyst
with
Merrill
Lynch
Capital
Markets
,
said
USX
may
have
received
orders
lost
by
competitors

who
were
involved
in
labor
contracts
earlier
this
year
.

He
said
USX
also
appeared
to
sell
a
richer
mix
of
steel
products
,
such
as
the
more
profitable
pipe
and
galvanized
coated
sheet
,
than
lower-priced
structural
goods
.

The
energy
segment
,
with
a
15
%
rise
in
operating
profit
,
is
clearly
the
company
's
strongest
.

Higher
crude
oil
prices
helped
boost
operating
profit
for
the
Marathon
Oil
Co.
unit
to
$
198
million
from
$
180
million
.

The
Texas
Oil
&
Gas
division
continues
to
operate
in
the
red
,
although
losses
narrowed
to
$
9
million
from
$
15
million
.

USX
announced
in
October
that
it
was
soliciting

The

that

Icahn
had
increased
his
stake
in
USX
to
13.1

threatened
a

A
lack
of
enthusiasm
with
the
latest
economic
data
hampered
the
stock
market
's
bid
to
extend
Tuesday
's
sharp
gains
,
as
prices
closed
slightly
higher
in
sluggish
trading
.

While
renewed
optimism
about
the
outlook
for
takeover
activity
boosted
several
so-called
deal
stocks
,
traders
said
profit-taking
weighed
on
the
market
,
with
blue-chips
bearing
the
brunt
of
the
selling
.

The
Dow
Jones
Industrial

,
which

drifted
on
either

with
a

of
just
0.82

.

Standard

's
500-Stock

added
0.84
to

the

was
equivalent
to
a

Tuesday

The
October
survey
of
corporate
purchasing
managers
,
as
expected
,
provided
evidence
that
economic
growth
remains
subdued
.

An
index
of
economic
activity
drawn
from
the
survey
stood
last
month
at
47.6
%
;
a
reading
above
50
%
would
have
indicated
that
the
manufacturing
sector
was
improving
.

But
with
the
index
proving
somewhat
better
than
expected
and
the
widely
anticipated
report
on
October
employment
scheduled
to
arrive
tomorrow
,
stock
prices
firmed
only
modestly
in
response
to
the
report
and
then
faltered
.

``
This

still
going

,
''
said
Philip
Puccio
,
head
of

trading
at

``
The
psychology
is
still
:
`
We
want

if
they
do
n't

we
're
going

Uncertainty
about
the
prospects
for
further
action
to
curtail
stock-index
arbitrage
,
a
form
of
program
trading
blamed
for
recent
volatility
in
the
market
,
also
contributed
to
its
lack
of
direction
,
Mr.
Puccio
said
.

Arbitrage-related
trading
during
the
session
was
confined
largely
to
a
round
of
buy
programs
near
the
close
,
which
helped
offset
the
impact
of
profit-taking
among
blue
chips
.

Trading
is
expected
to
remain
subdued
as
the
market
awaits
tomorrow
's
release
of
the
jobs
data
with
the
hope
that
it
will
point
toward
a
decline
in

a
revival
of

Program
trading
is
``
a
racket
,
''
complains
Edward
Egnuss
,
a
White
Plains
,
N.Y.
,
investor
and
electronics
sales
executive
,
``
and
it
's
not
to
the
benefit
of
the
small
investor
,
that
's
for
sure
.

''
But
although
he
thinks
that
it
is
hurting
him
,
he
doubts
it
could
be
stopped
.

Mr.
Egnuss
's
dislike
of
program
trading
is
echoed
by
many
small
investors
interviewed
by
Wall
Street
Journal
reporters
across
the
country
.

But
like
Mr.
Egnuss
,
few
expect
it
to
be
halted
entirely
,
and
a
surprising
number
doubt
it
should
be
.

``
I
think
program
trading
is
basically
unfair
to
the
individual
investor
,
''
says
Leo
Fields
,
a
Dallas
investor
.

He
notes
that
program
traders
have
a
commission
cost
advantage
because
of
the
quantity
of
their
trades
,
that
they
have
a
smaller
margin
requirement
than
individual
investors
do
and
that
they
often
can
figure
out
earlier
where
the
market
is
heading
.

But
he
blames
program
trading
for
only
some
of
the
market
's
volatility
.

He
also
considers
the
market
overvalued
and
cites
the
troubles
in
junk
bonds
.

He
adds
:
``
The
market
may
be
giving
us

another
message
,
that
a
recession
is
looming
.

''

Or
,
as
Dorothy
Arighi
,
an
interior
decorator
in
Arnold
,
Calif.
,
puts
it
:
``
All
kinds
of
funny
things
spook
the
market
these
days
.

''
But
she
believes
that
``
program
trading
creates
deviant
swings
.

It
's
not
a
sound
thing
;
there
's
no
inherent
virtue
in
it
.

''
She
adds
that
legislation
curbing
it
would
be
``
a
darned
good
idea
.

''

At
the
Charles
Schwab
&
Co.
office
in
Atlanta
's
Buckhead
district
,
a
group
of
investors
voices
skepticism
that
federal
officials
would
curb
program
trading
.

Citing

the
October
1987
crash
,
Glenn
Miller
says
,
``
It
's
like
the
last
crash
--
they
threatened
,
but
no
one
did
anything
.

''
A.
Donald
Anderson
,
a
59-year-old
Los
Angeles
investor

who
says
the
stock
market
's
``
fluctuations
and
gyrations
give
me

the
heebie-jeebies
,
''
does
n't
see
much
point
in
outlawing
program
trading
.

Those

who
still
want
to
do
it
``
will
just
find
some
way
to
get
around
''
any
attempt
to
curb
it
.

Similarly
,
Rick
Wamre
,
a
31-year-old
asset
manager
for
a
Dallas
real-estate
firm
,
would
like
to
see
program
trading
disappear
because
``
I
ca
n't
see
that
it
does
anything
for
the
market
or
the
country
.

''
Yet
he
is
n't
in
favor
of
new
legislation
.

``
I
think
we
've
got
enough
securities
laws
,
''
he
says
.

``
I
'd
much
rather
see
them
dealing
with
interest
rates
and
the
deficit
.

''

Peter
Anthony
,
who
runs
an
employment
agency
in
New
York
,
decries
program
trading
as
``
limiting
the
game
to
a
few
,
''
but
he
also
is
n't
sure
it
should
be
more
strictly
regulated
.

``
I
do
n't
want
to
denounce
it
because
denouncing
it
would
be
like
denouncing
capitalism
,
''
he
explains
.

And
surprising
numbers
of
small
investors
seem
to
be
adapting
to
greater
stock
market
volatility
and
say
they
can
live
with
program
trading
.

Glenn
Britta
,
a
25-year-old
New
York
financial
analyst

who
plays
options
for
his
personal
account
,
says
he
is
``
factoring
''
the
market
's
volatility
``
into
investment
decisions
.

''
He
adds
that
program
trading
``
increases
liquidity
in
the
market
.

You
ca
n't
hold
back
technology
.

''
And
the
practice
should
n't
be
stopped
,
he
says
,
because
``
even
big
players
are
n't
immune
to
the
rigors
of
program
trading
.

''

Also
in
New
York
,
Israel
Silverman
,
an
insurance-company
lawyer
,
comments
that
program
trading
``
increases
volatility
,
but
I
do
n't
think
it
should
be
banned
.

There
's
no
culprit
here
.

The
market
is
just
becoming
more
efficient
.

''
Arbitraging
on
differences
between
spot
and
futures
prices
is
an
important
part
of
many
financial
markets
,
he
says
.

He
adds
that
his
shares
in
a
company
savings
plan
are
invested
in
a
mutual
fund
,
and
volatility
,
on
a
given
day
,
may
hurt
the
fund
.

But
``
I
'm
a
long-term
investor
,
''
he
says
.

``
If
you
were
a
short-term
investor
,
you
might
be
more
leery
about
program
trading
.

''

Jim
Enzor
of
Atlanta
defends
program
trading
because
he
believes
that
it
can
bring
the
market
back
up
after
a
plunge
.

``
If
we
have
a
real
bad
day
,
the
program
would
say
,
`
Buy
,
'
''
he
explains
.

``
If
you
could
get
the
rhythm
of
the
program
trading
,
you
could
take
advantage
of
it
.

What
else
can
a
small
investor
do
?

Scott
Taccetta
,
a
Chicago
accountant
,
is
going
into
money-market
funds
.

Mr.
Taccetta
says
he
had
just
recouped
the
$
5,000
he
lost
in
the
1987
crash
when
he
lost
more
money
last
Oct.
13
.

Now
,
he
plans
to
sell
all
his
stocks
by
the
first
quarter
of
1990
.

In
October
,
before
the
market
dropped
,
Mrs.
Arighi
of
Arnold
,
Calif.
,
moved
to
sell
the
``
speculative

''
in
her
family
trust
``
so
we
will
be
able
to
withstand
all
this
flim-flammery

caused
by
program
trading

She
believes
that
the
only
answer
for
individuals
is
to
``
buy
stocks

that
'll
weather
any
storm

an
84-year-old
Chicago
housewife
,
has
become
amazingly
immune
to
stock-market
jolts
.

Mrs.
Gorman
took
advantage
of
low
prices
after
the
1987
crash
to
buy
stocks
and
has
hunted
for
other
bargains
since
the
Oct.
13
plunge
.

``
My
stocks
are
all
blue
chips

''
she
says
.

``
If
the
market
goes
down
,
I
figure
it

's
paper
profits
I
'm
losing
.

On
the
other
hand
,
if
it
goes
way
sky
high
,
I
always
sell

You
do
n't
want
to
get
yourself
too
upset

these

Your
Oct.
6
editorial
``
The
Ill
Homeless
''
referred
to
research
by
us
and
six
of
our
colleagues

that
was
reported
in
the
Sept.
8
issue
of
the
Journal
of
the
American
Medical
Association
.

Your
comments
implied
we
had
discovered
that
the
``
principal
cause
''
of
homelessness
is
to
be
found
in
the
large
numbers
of
mentally
ill
and
substance-abusing
people
in
the
homeless
population
.

We
have
made
no
such
statement
.

It
is
clear
that
most
mentally
ill
people
and
most
alcoholics
do
not
become
homeless
.

The
``
causes
''
of
homelessness
are
poorly
understood
and
complex
in
any
individual
case
.

In
quoting
from
our
research

you
emphasized
the
high
prevalance
of
mental
illness
and
alcoholism
.

You
did
not
note
that
the
homeless
people
we
examined
had
a
multitude
of
physical
disorders
in
addition
to
their
psychiatric
problems
and
substance
abuse
.

They
suffered
from
malnutrition
,
chest
diseases
,
cardiovascular
disorders
,
skin
problems
,
infectious
diseases
and
the
aftereffects
of
assaults
and
rape
.

Homeless
people
not
only
lack
safety
,
privacy
and
shelter
,
they
also
lack
the
elementary
necessities
of
nutrition
,
cleanliness
and
basic
health
care
.

In
a
recent
report
,
the
Institute
of
Medicine
pointed
out
that
certain
health
problems
may
predispose
a
person
to
homelessness
,
others
may
be
a
consequence
of
it
,
and
a
third
category
is
composed
of
disorders
whose
treatment
is
difficult
or
impossible
if
a
person
lacks
adequate
shelter
.

The
interactions
between
health
and
homelessness
are
complex
,
defying
sweeping
generalizations
as
to
``
cause
''
or
``
effect
.

''

If
we
look
to
the
future
,
preventing
homelessness
is
an
important
objective
.

This
will
require
us
to
develop
a
much

more
sophisticated
understanding
of
the
dynamics
of
homelessness
than
we
currently
possess
,
an
understanding

that
can
be
developed
only
through
careful
study
and
research
.

A
study
by
Tulane
Prof.
James
Wright
says
homelessness
is
due
to
a
complex
array
of
problems
,
with
the
common
thread
of
poverty
.

The
study
shows
that
nearly
40
%
of
the
homeless
population
is
made
up
of
women
and
children
and
that
only
25
%
of
the
homeless
exhibits

some
combination
of
drug
,
alcohol
and
mental
problems
.

According
to
Dr.
Wright
,
homelessness
is
``
simultaneously
a
housing
problem
,
an
employment
problem
,
a
demographic
problem
,
a
problem
of
social
disaffiliation
,
a
mental
health
problem
,
a
family
violence
problem
,
a
problem
created
by
the
cutbacks
in
social
welfare
spending
,
a
problem
resulting
from
the
decay
of
the
traditional
nuclear
family
,
and
a
problem
intimately
connected
to
the
recent
increase
in
the
number
of
persons
living
below
the
poverty
level
.

To
quote
the
highly
regarded
director
of
a
privately
funded
drop-in
center
for
the
homeless
in
New
York
:
``
If
you
're
homeless
,
you
do
n't
sleep
for
fear
of
being
robbed
or
murdered
.

After
your
first
three
weeks
of
sleep
deprivation
,
you
're
scarcely
in
touch
with
reality

any
more
;
without
psychiatric
treatment
,
you
may
well
be
unable
to
fend
for
yourself
ever
again
.

''

Some
of
the
homeless
,
obviously
,
had
pre-existing
mental
illness
or
addiction
.

But
many
others
have
fallen
through
cracks
in
the
economy
into
the
grim
,
brutal
world
of
our
city
streets
.

Once
there
,
what
ways
of
escape
are
open
to
them
other
than
drink
,
drugs
or
insanity
?

You
dismiss
as
``
sentimental
''
the
view
that
the
reduction
of
federal
housing-assistance
programs
by
77
%
might
have
played
a
significant
role
in
the
increased
number
of
men
and
women
sleeping
on
our
city
streets
during
the
Reagan-Bush
years
.

There
is
no
sign
that
you
bothered
to
consider
the
inverse
of
your
logic
:
namely
,
that
mental
illness
and
substance
abuse
might
be
to
some
degree
consequences
rather
than
causes
of
homelessness
.

Your
research
stopped
when
a
convenient
assertion
could
be
made
.

S.
Jenkins

Of
the
approximately
200
sponsors
of
the
recent
march
in
Washington
for
the
homeless
,
you
chose
to
cite
such
groups
as
the
National
Association
of
Home
Builders
and
the
International
Union
of
Bricklayers
and
Allied
Craftsmen
,
insinuating
that
the
march
got
its
major
support
from
self-serving
groups
that
``
know
a
good
thing
when
they
see
it
,
''
and
that
the
crusade
was
based
on
greed
or
the
profit
motive
.

But
is
n't
the
desire
for
profit

the
driving
force
behind
those

who
subscribe
to
,
and
advertise
in
,
your
paper
?

Why
did
n't
you
mention
the
YMCA
or
the
YWCA
or
Catholic
Charities
USA
or
a
hundred
other
nonprofit
organizations

that
participated
in
the
march
?

As
for
the
findings
on
the
203
Baltimore
homeless

who
underwent
psychiatric
examinations
,
I
suggest
you
conduct
your
own
survey
.

Choose
203
business
executives
,
including
,
perhaps
,
someone
from
your
own
staff
,
and
put
them
out
on
the
streets
,
to
be
deprived
for
one
month
of
their
homes
,
families
and
income
.

I
would
predict
that
within
a
short
time
most
of
them
would
find
Thunderbird

a
satisfactory
substitute
for
Chivas
Regal
and
that
their
``
normal
''
phobias
,
anxieties
,
depressions
and
substance
abuse
would
increase
dramatically
.

Wall
Street
's
big
securities
firms
face
the
prospect
of
having
their
credit
ratings
lowered
.

The
reason
:
Risks
from
the
firms
'
new
``
merchant
banking
''
activities
are
rising
as
revenue
from
the
industry
's
traditional
business
erodes
.

The
downgrading
of
debt
issued
by
CS
First
Boston
Inc.
,
parent
of
First
Boston
Corp.
,
by
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc.
,
coupled
with
a
Moody
's
announcement
that
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Holdings
Inc.
is
under
review
for
a
possible
downgrade
,
sent
shivers
through
the
brokerage
community

this
week
.

With
the
shudders
came
the
realization
that
some
of
Wall
Street
's
biggest
players
are
struggling
to
maintain
the
stellar
credit
standing
required
to
finance
their
activities
profitably
.

Securities
firms
are
among
the
biggest
issuers
of
commercial
paper
,
or
short-term
corporate
IOUs
,
which

they
sell
to
finance
their
daily
operations
.

The
biggest
firms
still
retain
the
highest
ratings
on
their
commercial
paper
.

But
Moody
's
warned
that
Shearson
's
commercial
paper
rating
could
be
lowered
soon
,
a
move

that
would
reduce
Shearson
's
profit
margins
on
its
borrowings
and
signal
trouble
ahead
for
other
firms
.

Shearson
is
62%-owned
by
American
Express
Co
.

``
Just
as
the
1980s
bull
market
transformed
the
U.S.
securities
business
,
so
too
will
the
more
difficult
environment
of
the
1990s
,
''
says
Christopher
T.
Mahoney
,
a
Moody
's
vice
president
.

``
A
sweeping
restructuring
of
the
industry
is
possible
.

''
Standard
&
Poor
's
Corp.
says
First
Boston
,
Shearson
and
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc.
,
in
particular
,
are
likely
to
have
difficulty
shoring
up
their
credit
standing
in
months
ahead
.

What
worries
credit-rating
concerns
the
most
is
that
Wall
Street
firms
are
taking
long-term
risks
with
their
own
capital
via
leveraged
buy-out
and
junk
bond
financings
.

That
's
a
departure
from
their
traditional
practice
of
transferring
almost
all
financing
risks
to
investors
.

Whereas
conventional
securities
financings
are
structured
to
be
sold
quickly
,
Wall
Street
's
new
penchant
for
leveraged
buy-outs
and
junk
bonds
is
resulting
in
long-term
lending
commitments

that
stretch
out
for
months
or
years
.

``
The
recent
disarray
in
the
junk
bond
market
suggests
that
brokers
may
become
longer-term
creditors
than
they
anticipated
and
may
face
long
delays
''
in
getting
their
money
back
,
says
Jeffrey
Bowman
,
a
vice
president
at
S&P
,
which
raised
a
warning
flag
for
the
industry
in
April
when
it
downgraded
CS
First
Boston
.

``
Wall
Street
is
facing
a
Catch-22
situation
,
''
says
Mr.
Mahoney
of
Moody
's
.

Merchant
banking
,
where
firms
commit
their
own
money
,
``
is
getting
riskier
,
and
there
's
less
of
it
to
go
around
.

''
In
addition
,
he
says
,
the
buy-out
business
is
under
pressure
``
because
of
the
junk
bond
collapse
,
''
meaning
that
returns
are
likely
to
decline
as
the
volume
of
junk-bond
financings
shrinks
.

In
a
leveraged
buy-out
,
a
small
group
of
investors
acquires
a
company
in
a
transaction
financed
largely
by
borrowing
,
with
the
expectation
that
the
debt
will
be
paid
with
funds
generated
by
the
acquired
company
's
operations
or
sales
of
its
assets
.

In
a
recent
report
,
Moody
's
said
it
``
expects
intense
competition
to
occur
through
the
rest
of
the
century
in
the
securities
industry
,
which
,
combined
with
overcapacity
,
will
create
poor
prospects
for
profitability
.

''
It
said
that
the
``
temptation
for
managements
to
ease
this
profit
pressure
by
taking
greater
risks
is
an
additional
rating
factor
.

''

Both
Moody
's
and
S&P
cited
First
Boston
's
reliance
in
recent
years
on
merchant
banking
,
which
has
been
responsible
for
a
significant
portion
of
the
closely
held
firm
's
profit
.

The
recent
cash
squeeze
at
Campeau
Corp.
,
First
Boston
's
most
lucrative
client
of
the
decade
,
is
proving
costly
to
First
Boston
because
it
arranged
more
than
$
3
billion
of
high-yield
,
high-risk
junk
financings
for
Campeau
units
.

In
addition
,
a
big
loan
that
First
Boston
made
to
Ohio
Mattress
Co
.

was
n't
repaid
on
time
when
its
$
450
million
junk
financing
for
a
buy-out
of
the
bedding
company
was
withdrawn
.

``
These
two
exposures
alone
represent
a
very
substantial
portion
of
CS
First
Boston
's
equity
,
''
Moody

's
said
.

``
Total
merchant
banking
exposures
are
in
excess
of
the
firm
's
equity
.

''
CS
First
Boston
,
however
,
benefits
from
the
backing
of
its
largest
shareholder
,
Credit
Suisse
,
Switzerland
's
third
largest
bank
.

Shearson
also
has
been
an
aggressive
participant
in
the
leveraged
buy-out
business
.

But
its
earnings
became
a
major
disappointment
as
its
traditional
retail
,
or
individual
investor
,
business
showed
no
signs
of
rebounding
from
the
slump

that
followed
the
October
1987
stock
market
crash
.

In
addition
,
Shearson
's
listed
$
2
billion
of
capital
is
overstated
,
according
to
the
rating
concerns
,
because
it
includes
$
1.7
billion
of
goodwill
.

Shearson
``
really
only
has
$
300
million
of
capital
,
''
says
Mr.
Bowman
of
S&P
.

A
Shearson
spokesman
said
the
firm
is
n't
worried
.

``
A
year
ago
,
Moody
's
also
had
Shearson
under
review
for
possible
downgrade
,
''
he
said
.

``
After
two
months
of
talks
,
our
rating
was
maintained
.

''
Drexel
,
meanwhile
,
already
competes
at
a
disadvantage
to
its
big
Wall
Street
rivals
because
it
has
a
slightly
lower
commercial
paper
rating
.

The
collapse
of
junk
bond
prices
and
the
cancellation
of
many
junk
bond
financings
apparently
have
taken
their
toll
on
closely
held
Drexel
,
the
leading
underwriter
in
that
market
.

The
firm
also
has
been
hit
with
big
financial
settlements
with
the
government
stemming
from
its
guilty
plea
to
six
felonies
related
to
a
big
insider-trading
scandal
.

Drexel

this
year
eliminated
its
retail
or
individual
customer
business
,
cutting
the
firm
's
workforce
almost
in
half
to
just
over
5,000
.

Recently
,
Drexel
circulated
a
private
financial
statement
among
several
securities
firms
showing
that
its
earnings
performance
has
diminished
this
year
from
previous
years
.

The
firm
's
capital
,
moreover
,
has
n't
grown
at
the
same
rate
as
in
the
past
,
officials
at
these
firms
say
.

Drexel
remains
confident
of
its
future
creditworthiness
.

``
We
're
well
positioned
with
$
1.7
billion
of
capital
,
''
a
Drexel
spokesman
said
.

``
And
as
a
leading
investment
and
merchant
banking
firm
,
the
fact
that
we
are
no
longer
subject
to
the
uncertainties
and
vicissitudes
of
the
retail
business
is
a
major
plus
in
our
view
.

Moreover
,
we
've
probably
been
the
most
aggressive
firm
on
the
Street
in
reducing
costs
,
which
are
down
around
40
%
over
the
last
six
months
.

avid
fan
of
a
proposition
on
next
week
's
ballot
to
help
build
a
replacement
for
Candlestick
Park
.

Small
wonder
,
since
he
's
asking
San
Francisco
taxpayers
to
sink
up
to
$
100
million
into
the
new
stadium
.

As
San
Francisco
digs
out
from
The
Pretty
Big
One
,
opponents
say
the
last
thing

the
city
can
afford
is
an
expensive
new
stadium
.

A
stadium
craze
is
sweeping
the
country
.

It
's
fueled
by
the
increasing
profitability
of
major-league
teams
.

Something
like
one-third
of
the
nation
's
60
largest
cities
are
thinking
about
new
stadiums
,
ranging
from
Cleveland
to
San
Antonio
and
St.
Petersburg
.

Most
boosters
claim
the
new
sports
complexes
will
be
moneymakers
for
their
city
.

Pepperdine
University
economist
Dean
Baim
scoffs
at
that
.

He
has
looked
at
14
baseball
and
football
stadiums
and
found
that
only
one
--
private
Dodger
Stadium
--
brought
more
money
into
a
city
than
it
took
out
.

Stadiums
tend
to
redistribute
existing
wealth
within
a
community
,
not
create
more
of
it
.

Voters
generally
agree
when
they
are
given
a
chance
to
decide
if
they
want
to
sink
their
own
tax
dollars
into
a
new
mega-stadium
.

San
Francisco
voters
rejected
a
new
ballpark
two
years
ago
.

Last
month
,
Phoenix
voters
turned
thumbs
down
on
a
$
100
million
stadium
bond
and
tax
proposition
.

Its
backers
fielded
every
important
interest
on
their
team
--
a
popular
mayor
,
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
the
major
media
--
and
spent
$
100,000
on
promotion
.

But
voters
decided
that
if
the
stadium
was
such
a
good
idea

someone
would
build
it

himself
,
and
rejected
it

59
%
to
41
%
.

In
San
Francisco
,
its
backers
concede
the
ballpark
is
at
best
running
even
in
the
polls
.

George
Christopher
,
the
former
San
Francisco
mayor

who
built
Candlestick
Park
for
the
Giants
in
the
1960s
,
wo
n't
endorse
the
new
ballpark
.

He
says
he
had
Candlestick
built
because
the
Giants
claimed
they
needed
10,000
parking
spaces
.

Since
the
new
park
will
have
only
1,500
spaces
,
Mr.
Christopher
thinks
backers
are
playing
some
fiscal
``
games
''
of
their
own
with
the
voters
.

Stadium
boosters
claim
that
without
public
money

they
would
never
be
built
.

Miami
Dolphins
owner
Joe
Robbie
disagrees
,
and
he
can
prove
it
.

Several
years
ago
he
gave
up
trying
to
persuade
Miami
to
improve
its
city-owned
Orange
Bowl
,
and
instead
built
his
own
$
100
million
coliseum
with
private
funds
.

He
did
n't
see
why
the
taxpayers
should
help
build
something

he
would
then
use
to
turn
a
healthy
profit
.

``
This
stadium
shows
that
anything

government
can
do
,
we
can
do
better
,
''
Mr.
Robbie
says
.

But
to
Moon
Landrieu
,
the
former
New
Orleans
mayor

who
helped
build
that
city
's
cavernous
,
money-losing
Superdome
,
questions
of
who

benefits
or
the
bottom
line
are
of
little
relevance
.

``
The
Superdome
is
an
exercise
in
optimism
,
a
statement
of
faith
,
''
he
has
said
.

``
It
is
the
very
building
of
it

that
is
important
,
not
how
much
of
it
is
used
or
its
economics
.

''

An
Egyptian
Pharaoh
could
n't
have
justified
his
pyramids
any
better
.

But
civilization
has
moved
forward
since
then
.

Today
taxpayers
get
to
vote
,
most
of
the
time
,
on
whether
they
want
to
finance
the
building
schemes
of
our
modern
political
pharaohs
,
or
let
private
money
erect
these
playgrounds
for
public
passions

Xerox
Corp.
has
told
employees
in
its
Crum
&
Forster
personal
insurance
operations
that
it
is
laying
off
about
300
people
,
or
25
%
of
the
staff
.

A
spokeswoman
for
Crum
&
Forster
said
employees
were
told
early
this
week
that
numerous
staff
functions
for
the
personal
insurance
lines
were
going
to
be
centralized
as
a
cost-cutting
move
.

She
said
the
move
would
result
in
a
after-tax
charge
of
less
than
$
4
million
to
be
spread
over
the
next
three
quarters
.

By
comparison
,
for
the
first
nine
months
,
Xerox
earned
$
492
million
,
or
$
4.55

a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
12.97
billion
.

Earnings
at
Xerox
's
financial-services
operations
actually
rose
slightly
,
but
that
was
largely
because
capital
gains
at
Crum
&
Forster
offset
Hurricane
Hugo
payments
and
the
reserves
set
up
to
cover
future
payments
.

insurance
has
been
a
tough
business
in
recent
quarters
,
as
pricing
has
been
cutthroat
and
natural
disasters
such
as
Hurricane
Hugo
and
the
California
earthquake
have
resulted
in
huge
payments
.

Researchers
at
American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
Co.
's
Bell
Laboratories
reported
they
raised
the
electrical
current-carrying
capacity
of
new
superconductor
crystals
by
a
factor
of
100
,
moving
the
materials
closer
to
commercial
use
.

The
scientists
said
they
created
small
changes
in
the
crystal-lattice
structures
of
the
superconductors
to
raise
the
amount
of
current
that
single
crystals
could
carry
to
600,000
amps
per
square
centimeter
in
a
moderately
strong
magnetic
field
.

The
scientists
said
they
made
the
advance
with
yttrium-containing
superconductors
cooled
to
liquid-nitrogen
temperature
,
or
minus
321
degrees
Fahrenheit
.

Their
report
appears
in
today
's
issue
of
the
journal
Nature
.

The
finding
marks
a
significant
step
in
research
on
``
bulk
''
superconductors
,
which
are
aimed
at
use
in
wires
for
motors
,
magnets
,
generators
and
other
applications
.

Scientists
had
obtained
even
higher
current-carrying
capacity
in
thin
films
of
the
new
superconductors
,
but
have
had
problems
increasing
the
amount
of
current
that
bulk
crystals
could
carry
.

Superconductors
conduct
electricity
without
resistance
when
cooled
.

A
family
of
ceramic
superconductors
discovered
during
the
past
three
years
promise
new
technologies
such
as
cheaper
electrical
generation
--
but
only
if
their
current-carrying
capacity
can
be
raised
.

The
AT&T
advance
shows
how
one
aspect
of
the
current-carrying
problem
can
be
overcome
.

But
``
it
wo
n't
lead
to
imminent
use
''
of
new
superconductors
,
cautioned
Robert
B.
van
Dover
,
one
of
the
AT&T
researchers
.

He
added
that
the
current-carrying
capacity
of
multi-crystal
samples
of
superconductors
remains
too
low
for
most
practical
uses
because
of
so-called
weak
links
between
crystals
.

Such
multi-crystal
materials
will
probably
be
needed
for
commercial
applications
.

Mr.
van
Dover
said
the
AT&T
team
created
the
desired
crystal
changes
by
bombarding
superconductor
samples
with
neutrons
,
a
process

that
creates
some
radioactivity
in
the
samples
and
may
not
be
feasible
for
large-scale
commercial
use
.

Still
,
scientists
breathed
a
collective
sigh
of
relief
about
the
finding
,
because
it
demonstrates
how
to
overcome
the
``
flux
pinning
''
problem
that
earlier
this
year
was
widely
publicized
as
undercutting
new
superconductors
'
potential
.

The
problem
involves
the
motion
of
small
magnetic
fields
within
superconductor
crystals
,
limiting
their
current-carrying
capacity
.

Mr.
van
Dover
said
the
crystal
changes
his
team
introduced
apparently
pins
the
magnetic
fields
in
place
,
preventing
them
from
lowering
current-carrying
capacity
.

Mr.
van
Dover
added
that
researchers
are
trying
to
determine
precisely
what
crystal
changes
solved
the
problem
.

Determining
that
may
enable
them
to
develop
better
ways
to
introduce
the
needed
crystal-lattice
patterns
.

The
AT&T
team
also
is
trying
to
combine
their
latest
superconductor
process
with
``
melt-textured
growth
,
''
a
process
discovered
earlier
at
Bell
Laboratories
.

The
combined
processes
may
significantly
raise
the
current-carrying
capacity
of
multi-crystal
samples
.

Follow-up
report
:

You
now
may
drop
by
the
Voice
of
America
offices
in
Washington
and
read
the
text
of
what

the
Voice
is
broadcasting
to
those
130
million
people
around
the
world

who
tune
in
to
it

each
week
.

You
can
even
take
notes
--
extensive
notes
,
for
the
Voice
folks
wo
n't
look
over
your
shoulder
--
about
what

you
read
.

You
can
do
all
this
even
if
you
're
not
a
reporter
or
a
researcher
or
a
scholar
or
a
member
of
Congress
.

And
my
newspaper
can
print
the
text
of
those
broadcasts
.

Until
the
other
day
,
you
as
an
ordinary
citizen
of
this
democracy
had
no
right
to
see
what

your
government
was
telling
your
cousins
around
the
world
.

That
was
the
law
.

And
I
apparently
had
no
right
to
print
hither
what

the
Voice
was
booming
to
yon
.

It
was
censorship
.

It
was
outrageous
.

And
it
was
stupid
.

The
theory
was
that
the
Voice
is
a
propaganda
agency
and
this
government
should
n't
propagandize
its
own
people
.

That
sounds
neat
,
but
this
government
--
any
government
--
propagandizes
its
own
people

every
day
.

Government
press
releases
,
speeches
,
briefings
,
tours
of
military
facilities
,
publications
are
all
propaganda
of
sorts
.

Propaganda
is
just
information
to
support
a
viewpoint
,
and
the
beauty
of
a
democracy
is
that
it
enables
you
to
hear
or
read
every
viewpoint
and
then
make
up
your
own
mind
on
an
issue
.

The
restrictions
on
viewing
and
dissemination
of
Voice
material
were
especially
absurd
:
An
agency
in
the
information
business
was
not
being
allowed
to
inform
.

In
June
1988
,
I
wrote
in
this
space
about
this
issue
.

Assuming
it
was
n't
one
of
those
columns
that
you
clipped
and
put
on
the
refrigerator
door
,
I
'll
review
the
facts
.

The
Voice
of
America
is
a
government
agency

that
broadcasts
news
and
views
--
some
might
say
propaganda
--
in
43
languages
to
130
million
listeners
around
the
world
.

It
does
a
first-rate
job
.

Its
budget
$
184
million
--
is
paid
for
by
you
.

But
a
1948
law
barred
the
``
dissemination
''
of
that
material
in
the
U.S
.

The
law
let
scholars
,
reporters
and
researchers
read
texts
of
VOA
material
,
only
at
VOA
headquarters
in
Washington
,
but
it
barred
them
from
copying
texts
.

And
,
of
course
,
there
's
that
word
``
dissemination
.

''

How
's
that
again
?

``
You
may
come
by
the
agency
to
read
but
not
copy
either
manually
or
by
photocopying
,
''
a
Voice
official
explained
when
I
asked
.

What
if
I
tune
in
my
short-wave
radio
,
transcribe
an
editorial
or
program
,
and
print
it
in
my
newspaper
?

``
Nor
are
you
free
to
reprint
such
material
,
''
I
was
advised
.

That
sounded
a
lot
like
censorship
,
so
after
years
of
letters
and
conversations

that
went
nowhere
,
I
sued
.

A
couple
of
weeks
ago
,
I
lost
the
case
in
federal
district
court
in
Des
Moines
.

At
least
,
that
's
the
way

it
was
reported
.

And
,
indeed
,
the
lawsuit
was
dismissed
.

But
I
--
I
like
to
think
of
it
in
terms
of
we
,
all
of
us
--
won
the
point
.

For
a
funny
thing
happened
on
the
way
to
the
ruling
:
The
United
States
Information
Agency
,
which
runs
the
Voice
,
changed
its
position
on
three
key
points
.

--
The
USIA
said
that
,
on
reflection
,
of
course

I
could
print
anything

I
could
get
my
hands
on
.

The
word
dissemination
,
it
decided
,
referred
only
to
itself
.

``
The
USIA
officially
and
publicly
declared
the
absolute
right
of
everyone
except
the
USIA
to
disseminate
agency
program
materials
in
the
United
States
,
''
my
lawyer
,
the
scholarly
Mark
McCormick
of
Des
Moines
,
said
in
a
memo
pointing
out
the
facts
and
trying
to
make
me
feel
good
after
the
press
reported
that
I
had
lost
.

The
court
noted
the
new
USIA
position
but
,
just
in
case
,
officially
found
``
that
Congress
did
not
intend
to
preclude
plaintiffs
from
disseminating
USIA
information
domestically
.

''

--
The
USIA
said
that
,
on
reflection
,
anyone
could
view
the
VOA
materials
,
not
just
the
reporters
,
scholars
,
researchers
and
congressmen

who
are
mentioned
in
the
statute
.

``
The
USIA
publicly
and
officially
stated
in
the
litigation
that
all
persons
are
allowed
access
to
the
materials
,
notwithstanding
the
statutory
designations
,
because
the
USIA
has
determined
that
it
will
not
check
the
credentials
of
any
person
appearing
and
requesting
to
see
the
materials
,
''
Mr.
McCormick
noted
.

--
And
the
USIA
said
that
all
of
us
could
take
extensive
notes
.

``
The
agency
publicly
and
officially
declared
in
the
lawsuit
that
persons

who
examine
the
materials
may
make
notes
and
,
while
the
agency
position
is
that
persons
may
not
take
verbatim
notes
,
no
one
will
check
to
determine
what
notes
a
person
has
taken
,
''
Mr.
McCormick
reported
.

I
had
sought
,
in
my
suit
,
the
right
to
print
Voice
material
,
which
had
been
denied
me
,
and
I
had
sought
a
right
to
receive
the
information
,
arguing
in
effect
that
a
right
to
print
government
information
is
n't
very
helpful
if
I
have
no
right
to
get
the
information
.

But
the
court
disagreed
.

``
The
First
Amendment
proscribes
the
government
from
passing
laws
abridging
the
right
to
free
speech
,
''
Judge
Donald
O'Brien
ruled
.

``
The
First
Amendment
does
not
prescribe
a
duty
upon
the
government
to
assure
easy
access
to
information
for
members
of
the
press
.

''

So
now
the
situation
is
this
:
You
have
a
right
to
read
Voice
of
America
scripts
if
you
do
n't
mind
traveling
to
Washington

every
week
or
so
and
visiting
the
Voice
office
during
business
hours
.

I
have
a
right
to
print
those
scripts
if
I
go
there
and
laboriously
--
but
no
longer
surreptitiously
--
copy
them
out
in
long
hand
.

But
neither
of
us
can
copy
the
material
on
a
Xerox
machine
or
have
it
sent
to
us
.

In
an
era
when
every
government
agency
has
a
public-relations
machine

that
sends
you
stuff
whether
you
want
it
or
not
,
this
does
seem
odd
.

Indeed
,
Judge
O'Brien
ruled
that
``
it
would
be
easy
to
conclude
that
the
USIA
's
position
is
`
inappropriate
or
even
stupid
,
'
''
but
it
's
the
law
.

So
the
next
step
,
I
suspect
,
is
to
try
to
get
the
law
changed
.

We
(
I
assume
you
're
in
this
with
me
at
this
point
)
need
to
get
three
words
--
``
for
examination
only
''
--
eliminated
from
the
law
.

Section
501
of
the
United
States
Information
and
Educational
Exchange
Act
of
1948
says
Voice
material
shall
be
available
to
certain
of
us
(
but
now
,
thanks
to
the
USIA
's
new
position
,
all
of
us
)
``
for
examination
only
.

''
If
those
words
were
n't
there
,
the
nice
people
at
the
Voice
would
be
able
to
send
you

the
information
or
,
at
the
very
least
,
let
you
photocopy
it
.

This
is
not
a
trivial
issue
.

``
You
have
...
raised
important
questions

which
ought
to
be
answered
:
What
does
USIA
say
about
America
abroad
;
how
do
we
say
it
;
and
how
can
American
taxpayers
get
the
answers
to
these
questions
?
''
a
man
wrote
me

a
couple
of
years
ago
.

The
man
was
Charles
Z.
Wick
.

At
the
time
,
he
was
director
of
the

He
had
no
answers
then
.

Now
there
are
some
.

This
democracy
is
suddenly
a
little
more
democratic
.

I
feel
pretty
good
about
it
.

Mr.
Gartner
is
editor
and
co-owner
of
the
Daily
Tribune
in
Ames
,
Iowa
,
and
president
of
NBC
News
in
New
York
.

If
you
'd
really
rather
have
a
Buick
,
do
n't
leave
home
without
the
American
Express
card
.

Or
so
the
slogan
might
go
.

American
Express
Co.
and
General
Motors
Corp.
's
beleaguered
Buick
division
are
joining
forces
in
a
promotion
aimed
at
boosting
Buick
's
sales
while
encouraging
broader
use
of
the
American
Express
card
.

The
companies
are
giving
four-day
vacations
for
two
to
Buick
buyers

who
charge
all
or
part
of
their
down
payments
on
the
American
Express
green
card
.

They
have
begun
sending
letters
explaining
the
program
,
which
began
Oct.
18
and
will
end
Dec.
18
,
to
about
five
million
card
holders
.

Neither
company
would
disclose
the
program
's
cost
.

Buick
approached
American
Express
about
a
joint
promotion
because
its
card
holders
generally
have
a
``
good
credit
history
''
and
are
``
good
at
making
payments
,
''
says
a
spokeswoman
for
the
division
.

American
Express
also
represents
the
upscale
image
``
we
're
trying
to
project
,
''
she
adds
.

Buick
has
been
seeking
for
the
past
few
years
to
restore
its
reputation
as
``
the
doctor
's
car
''
--
a
product
for
upscale
professionals
.

Sales
were
roughly
flat
in
the
1989
model
year
compared
with
a
year
earlier
,
though
industry
sales
fell
.

But
since
the
1990
model
year
began
Oct.
1
,
Buick
sales
have
plunged
33
%
.

For
American
Express
,
the
promotion
is
part
of
an
effort
to
broaden
the
use
of
its
card
for
retail
sales
,
where
the
company
expects
to
get
much
of
the
future
growth
in
its
card
business
.

Traditionally
,
the
card
has
been
used
mainly
for
travel
and
entertainment
expenses
.

Phillip
Riese
,
an
American
Express
executive
vice
president
,
says
the
promotion
with
Buick
is
his
company
's
first
with
an
auto
maker
,
but
``
hopefully
{
will
be
}
the
first
of
many
''
in
the
company
's
effort
to
promote
its
green
card
as
``
the
total
car-care
card
.

''
To
that
end
,
American
Express
has
been
signing
up
gasoline
companies
,
car
repair
shops
,
tire
companies
and
car
dealers
to
accept
the
card
.

Many
auto
dealers
now
let
car
buyers
charge
part
or
all
of
their
purchase
on
the
American
Express
card
,
but
few
card
holders
realize
this
,
Mr.
Riese
says
.

Until
now
,
however
,
buyers

who
wanted
to
finance
part
of
a
car
purchase
through
General
Motors
Acceptance
Corp.
could
n't
put
their
down
payment
on
a
charge
card
because
of
possible
conflicts
with
truth-in-lending
and
state
disclosure
laws
over
finance
rates
,
says
a
spokesman
for
the
GM
finance
arm
.

But
GMAC
approved
the
Buick
program
,
he
says
,
because
the
American
Express
green
card
requires
payment
in
full
upon
billing
,
and
so
does
n't
carry
any
finance
rates
.

Mr.
Riese
says
American
Express
considers
GM
and
Buick
``
very
sophisticated
direct-mail
marketers
,
''
so
``
by
joining
forces
with
them

we
have
managed
to
maximize
our
direct-mail
capability
.

''
In
addition
,
Buick
is
a
relatively
respected
nameplate
among
American
Express
card
holders
,
says
an
American
Express
spokeswoman
.

When
the
company
asked
members
in
a
mailing

which
cars
they
would
like
to
get
information
about
for
possible
future
purchases
,
Buick
came
in
fourth
among
U.S.
cars
and
in
the
top
10
of
all
cars
,
the
spokeswoman
says
.

American
Express
has
more
than
24
million
card
holders
in
the
U.S.
,
and
over
half
have
the
green
card
.

GMAC
screened
the
card-member
list
for
holders
more
than
30
years
old
with
household
incomes
over
$
45,000

who
had
n't
``
missed
any
payments
,
''
the
Buick
spokeswoman
says
.

Some
3.8
million
of
the
five
million

who
will
get
letters
were
preapproved
for
credit
with
GMAC
.

These
3.8
million
people
also
are
eligible
to
get
one
percentage
point
off
GMAC
's
advertised
finance
rates
,
which
start
at
6.9
%
for
two-year
loan
contracts
.

A
spokesman
for
Visa
International
's
U.S.
subsidiary
says
his
company
is
using
promotions
to
increase
use
of
its
cards
,
but
does
n't
have
plans
for
a
tie-in
similar
to
the
American
Express-Buick
link
.

Three
divisions
at
American
Express
are
working
with
Buick
on
the
promotion
:
the
establishment
services
division
,
which
is
responsible
for
all
merchants
and
companies

that
accept
the
card
;
the
travel
division
;
and
the
merchandise
sales
division
.

The
vacation
packages
include
hotel
accommodations
and
,
in
some
cases
,
tours
or
tickets
to
local
attractions
,
but
not
meals
.

Destinations
are
Chicago
;
Honolulu
;
Las
Vegas
,
Nev.
;
Los
Angeles
;
Miami
Beach
,
Fla.
;
New
Orleans
;
New
York
;
Orlando
,
Fla.
;
San
Francisco
;
and
Washington
,
D.C.

A
buyer

who
chooses
to
fly
to
his
destination
must
pay
for
his
own
ticket
but
gets
a
companion
's
ticket
free
if
they
fly
on
United
Airlines
.

In
lieu
of
the
vacation
,
buyers
can
choose
among
several
prizes
,
including
a
grandfather
clock
or
a
stereo
videocassette
recorder
.

Card
holders

who
receive
the
letter
also
are
eligible
for
a
sweepstakes
with
Buick
cars
or
a
Hawaii
vacation
as
prizes
.

If
they
test-drive
a
Buick
,
they
get
an
American
Express
calculator
.

This
is
n't
Buick
's
first
travel-related
promotion
.

A
few
years
ago
,
the
company
offered
two
round-trip
tickets
on
Trans
World
Airlines
to
buyers
of
its
Riviera
luxury
car
.

The
promotion
helped
Riviera
sales
exceed
the
division
's
forecast
by
more
than
10
%
,
Buick
said
at
the
time
.

Intelogic
Trace
Inc.
,
San
Antonio
,
Texas
,
said
it
bought
2.7
million
shares
,
or
about
18
%
,
of
its
common
stock
from
an
unaffiliated
shareholder
for
$
3.625

a
share
,
or
$
9.9
million
.

The
move
boosts
Intelogic
Chairman
Asher
Edelman
's
stake
to
20
%
from
16.2
%
and
may
help
prevent
Martin
Ackerman
from
making
a
run
at
the
computer-services
concern
.

Mr.
Ackerman
already
is
seeking
to
oust
Mr.
Edelman
as
chairman
of
Datapoint
Corp.
,
an
Intelogic
affiliate
.

The
action
followed
by
one
day

an
Intelogic
announcement
that
it
will
retain
an
investment
banker
to
explore
alternatives
``
to
maximize
shareholder
value
,
''
including
the
possible
sale
of
the
company
.

In
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
yesterday
,
Intelogic
shares
rose
37.5
cents
to
close
at
$
2.75
.

Mr.
Edelman
declined
to
specify
what
prompted
the
recent
moves
,
saying
they
are
meant
only
to
benefit
shareholders
when
``
the
company
is
on
a
roll
.

''
He
added
,
``
This
has
nothing
to
do
with
Marty
Ackerman
and
it
is
not
designed
,
particularly
,
to
take
the
company
private
.

''

But
Mr.
Ackerman
said
the
buy-back
,
and
the
above-market
price
paid
,
prove
that
Mr.
Edelman
is
running
scared
.

The
Labor
Department
cited
USX
Corp.
for
numerous
health
and
safety
violations
at
two
Pennsylvania
plants
,
and
proposed
$
7.3
million
in
fines
,
the
largest
penalty
ever
proposed
for
alleged
workplace
violations
by
an
employer
.

The
department
's
Occupational
Safety
and
Health
Administration
proposed
fines
of
$
6.1
million
for
alleged
violations
at
the
company
's
Fairless
Hills
,
Pa.
,
steel
mill
;
that
was
a
record
for
proposed
penalties
at
any
single
facility
.

OSHA
cited
nearly
1,500
alleged
violations
of
federal
electrical
,
crane-safety
,
record-keeping
and
other
requirements
.

A
second
citation
covering
the
company
's
Clairton
,
Pa.
,
coke
works
involved
more
than
200
alleged
violations
of
electrical-safety
and
other
requirements
,
for
which

OSHA
proposed
$
1.2
million
in
fines
.

Labor
Secretary
Elizabeth
Dole
said
,
``
The
magnitude
of
these
penalties
and
citations
is
matched
only
by
the
magnitude
of
the
hazards
to
workers

which
resulted
from
corporate
indifference
to
worker
safety
and
health
,
and
severe
cutbacks
in
the
maintenance
and
repair
programs
needed
to
remove
those
hazards
.

''

OSHA
said
there
have
been
three
worker
fatalities
at
the
two
plants
in
the
past
two
years
and
17
deaths
since
1972
.

Gerard
Scannell
,
the
head
of
OSHA
,
said
USX
managers
have
known
about
many
of
the
safety
and
health
deficiencies
at
the
plants
for
years
,
``
yet
have
failed
to
take
necessary
action
to
counteract
the
hazards
.

''

``
Particularly
flagrant
,
''
Mrs.
Dole
said
,
``
are
the
company
's
numerous
failures
to
properly
record
injuries
at
its
Fairless
works
,
in
spite
of
the
firm
promise

it
had
made
in
an
earlier
corporate-wide
settlement
agreement
to
correct
such
discrepancies
.

''
That
settlement
was
in
April
1987
.

A
USX
spokesman
said
the
company
had
n't
yet
received
any
documents
from
OSHA
regarding
the
penalty
or
fine
.

``
Once
we
do
,
they
will
receive
very
serious
evaluation
,
''
the
spokesman
said
.

``
No
consideration
is
more
important
than
the
health
and
safety
of
our
employees
.

''

USX
said
it
has
been
cooperating
with
OSHA
since
the
agency
began
investigating
the
Clairton
and
Fairless
works
.

He
said
that
,
if
and
when
safety
problems
were
identified
,
they
were
corrected
.

The
USX
citations
represented
the
first
sizable
enforcement
action
taken
by
OSHA
under
Mr.
Scannell
.

He
has
promised
stiffer
fines
,
though
the
size
of
penalties
sought
by
OSHA
have
been
rising
in
recent
years
even
before
he
took
office

this
year
.

``
The
big
problem
is
that
USX
management
has
proved
unwilling
to
devote
the
necessary
resources
and
manpower
to
removing
hazards
and
to
safeguarding
safety
and
health
in
the
plants
,
''
said
Linda
Anku
,
OSHA
regional
administrator
in
Philadelphia
.

USX
has
15
working
days
to
contest
the
citations
and
proposed
penalties
,
before
the
independent
Occupational
Safety
and
Health
Review
Commission
.

Before
the
USX
case
,
OSHA
's
largest
proposed
fine
for
one
employer
was
$
4.3
million
for
alleged
safety
violations
at
John
Morrell
&
Co.
,
a
meatpacking
subsidiary
of
United
Brands
Co.
,
Cincinnati
.

The
company
is
contesting
the
fine
.

World
sugar
futures
prices
soared
on
rumors
that
Brazil
,
a
major
grower
and
exporter
,
might
not
ship
sugar

this
crop
year
and
next
.

Prices
also
were
boosted
by
another
rumor
that
Mexico
,
usually
a
large
producer
and
exporter
,
might
have
to
buy
a
large
quantity
of
sugar
.

Although
traders
rushed
to
buy
futures
contracts
,
many
remained
skeptical
about
the
Brazilian
development
,
which
could
n't
be
confirmed
,
analysts
said
.

The
March
and
May
contracts
rose
to
fresh
life-of-contract
highs
of
14.54
cents
and
14.28
cents
at
their
best
levels
of
the
day
.

The
March
delivery
,
which
has
no
limits
,
settled
at
14.53
cents
,
up
0.56
cent

a
pound
.

The
May
contract
,
which
also
is
without
restraints
,
ended
with
a
gain
of
0.54
cent
to
14.26
cents
.

The
July
delivery
rose
its
daily
permissible
limit
of
0.50
cent

a
pound
to
14.00
cents
,
while
other
contract
months
showed
near-limit
advances
.

According
to
reports
carried
by
various
news
services
,
the
Brazilian
government
told
its
sugar
producers
that
they
wo
n't
be
allowed
to
export
sugar
during
the
current
1989-90
season
,
which
began
May
1
,
and
the
1990-91
season
so
that
it
can
be
used
to
produce
alcohol
for
automobile
fuel
.

One
analyst
,
Arthur
Stevenson
,
of
Prudential-Bache
Securities
,
New
York
,
estimated
that
65
%
or
more
of
Brazil
's
newly
made
automobiles
run
on
alcohol
and
ca
n't
use
gasoline
.

``
This
is
a
demand

that
must
be
met
,
regardless
of
the
price
of
oil
,
''
said
Mr.
Stevenson
.

Brazil
is
the
third-largest
producer
and
the
fifth-largest
exporter
of
sugar
in
the
world
.

A
shift
to
producing
more
alcohol
and
less
sugar
had
been
expected
,
but
the
latest
news
,
if
true
,
indicates
a
more
drastic
shift
than
had
been
anticipated
.

During
the
current
crop
year
,
Brazil
was
expected
to
produce
6.9
million
tons
of
sugar
,
a
drop
from
8.1
million
tons
in
1988-89
.

Its
1989-90
exports
were
expected
to
total
645,000
tons
in
contrast
to
shipments
of
1.5
million
tons
in

``
It
is
these
645,000
tons

that
are
in
question
for
this
crop
year
,
''
explained
Judith
Ganes
,
analyst
for
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
,
New
York
.

``
Producers
were
granted
the
right
earlier
this
year
to
ship
sugar
and
the
export
licenses
were
expected
to
have
begun
to
be
issued
''
yesterday
.

As
a
result
,
Ms.
Ganes
said
,
it
is
believed
that
little
or
no
sugar
from
the
1989-90
crop
has
been
shipped
yet
,
even
though
the
crop
year
is
six
months
old
.

More
than
a
half
of
all
sugar
produced
in
Brazil
goes
for
alcohol
production
,
according
to
Ms.
Ganes
.

Also
,
there
has
been
a
switch
in
the
past
decade
to
planting
of
orange
trees
in
areas

that
were
previously
used
for
cane
,
and
this
change
is
being
felt
now
,
she
said
.

Most
important
,
Ms.
Ganes
noted
,
``
Brazilian
officials
said
that
no
decision
has
as
yet
been
made
on
the
suspension
of
exports
.

''

Thomas
Oxnard
,
sugar
analyst
for
PaineWebber
in
Hackensack
,
N.J.
,
said
:
``
I
am
highly
skeptical
that
Brazil
will
curtail
sugar
exports
,
particularly
with
the
price
of
sugar
at
over
14
cents

a
pound
.

''

Above
all
,
Mr.
Oxnard
noted
,
the
situation
is
extremely
confused
.

``
Professional
sugar
people
here
who
have
strong
contacts
with
the
Brazilian
sugar
industry
have
been
unable
to
confirm
the
reports
or
get
enough
information
to
clarify
the
situation
,
''
he
said
.

``
It
's
the
type
of
nervous
atmosphere
in
which

a
report
can
be
put
out
,
such
as
the
one
saying
exports
will
be
suspended
,
and
no
one
can
confirm
it
.

''

Mr.
Oxnard
observed
that
the
situation
in
Brazil
is
also
very
complicated
.

On
the
one
hand
,
Brazil
started
an
ethanol
program
about
15
years
ago
to
fuel
a
huge
portion
of
its
national
fleet
of
cars
and
is
now
committed
to
this
program
.

``
It
has
to
weigh
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
relatively
high
price
of
sugar

it
can
earn
on
the
export
market
in
making
decisions
as
to
whether
to
produce
sugar
or
alcohol
,
''
Mr.
Oxnard
said
.

Mexico
,
which
is
normally
a
sugar
exporter
,
has
had
production
problems
in
the
past
two
years
,
analysts
said
.

Last
year
,
it
had
to
buy
sugar
on
the
world
market
to
meet
export
commitments
,
they
noted
.

This
year

it
is
expected
to
be
a
net
importer
and
is
said
to
be
seeking
to
buy
about
200,000
tons
of
sugar
to
meet
internal
needs
,
analysts
said
.

In
other
commodity
markets
yesterday
:

ENERGY
:
Petroleum
futures
were
generally
higher
with
heating
oil
leading
the
way
.

On
the
New
York
Mercantile
Exchange
,
heating
oil
for
December
delivery
increased
1.25
cents
to
settle
at
60.36
cents

a
gallon
.

Gasoline
futures
were
mixed
to
unchanged
.

But
the
strength
in
heating
oil
helped
push
up
crude
oil
.

West
Texas
Intermediate
crude
for
December
delivery
rose
13
cents

a
barrel
to
settle
at
$
20.07
.

The
firmness
in
heating
oil
was
attributed
to
colder
weather
in
parts
of
the
U.S.
and
to
the
latest
weekly
report
by
the
American
Petroleum
Institute
,
which
showed
a
decline
in
inventories
of
the
fuel
.

GRAINS
AND
SOYBEANS
:
Prices
closed
mostly
higher
in
relatively
light
trading
as
farmers
continued
to
withhold
their
crops
from
the
marketplace
in
the
hope
of
higher
prices
to
come
.

Trading
was
muted
in
part
because
of
the
observance
of
All
Saints
'
Day
across
much
of
Europe
.

Continued
export
demand
also
supported
prices
.

As
an
indicator
of
the
tight
grain
supply
situation
in
the
U.S.
,
market
analysts
said
that
late
Tuesday

the
Chinese
government
,
which
often
buys
U.S.
grains
in
quantity
,
turned
instead
to
Britain
to
buy
500,000
metric
tons
of
wheat
.

Traders
said
prices
also
were
supported
by
widespread
rumors
that
the
Soviet
Union
is
on
the
verge
of
receiving
most
favored
nation
status
from
the
U.S
.

That
designation
would
,
among
other
things
,
provide
more
generous
credit
terms
under
which

the
Soviets
could
purchase
grain
.

The
Soviets
are
widely
believed
to
need
additional
supplies
,
despite
running
up
record
one-month
purchases
of
310
million
bushels
of
corn
in
October
.

COPPER
:
Futures
prices
rose
,
extending
Tuesday
's
gains
.

The
December
contract
advanced
2.50
cents

a
pound
to
$
1.1650
.

Buying
for
the
most
part
carried
over
from
the
previous
session
,
and
traders
apparently
ignored
reports
that
a
Chilean
mine
strike
may
have
ended
almost
before
it
began
,
an
analyst
said
.

According
to
news
service
reports
,
most
workers
at
the
Disputado
mines
owned
by
Exxon
Corp.
agreed
to
a
new
two-year
wage
contract

that
includes
a
5
%
increase
and
other
benefits
.

However
,
some
workers
have
n't
yet
accepted
the
new
contract
and
are
continuing
negotiations
,
the
analyst
said
.

Separately
,
Reuter
reported
that
the
Papua-New
Guinea
government
urged
its
Parliament
to
extend
a
state
of
emergency
in
copper-rich
Bougainville
Island
for
two
months
.

The
Bougainville
copper
mine
has
been
inoperative
since
May
15
because
of
attacks
by
native
landowners

who
want
Bougainville
to
secede
from
Papua-New
Guinea
.

,
filed

.

Under

The
Avon
,
Conn.
,
company
's
stock
hit
a
high
in
1983
after
it
unveiled
its
Adam
home
computer
,
but
the
product
was
plagued
with
glitches
and
the
company
's
fortunes
plunged
.

But
Coleco
bounced
back
with
the
introduction
of
the
Cabbage
Patch
dolls
,
whose
sales
hit
$
600
million
in
1985
.

But
as
the
craze
died
,
Coleco
failed
to
come
up
with
another
winner
and
filed
for
bankruptcy-law
protection
in
July
1988
.

The
plan
was
filed
jointly
with
unsecured
creditors
in
federal
bankruptcy
court
in
New
York
and
must
be
approved
by
the
court
.

The
limits
to
legal
absurdity
stretched
another
notch

this
week
when
the
Supreme
Court
refused
to
hear
an
appeal
from
a
case

that
says
corporate
defendants
must
pay
damages
even
after
proving
that
they
could
not
possibly
have
caused
the
harm
.

We
can
understand
and
share
the
compassion

that
makes
judges
sometimes
wish
to
offer
a
kind
of
Solomonic
aid
to
those

who
've
been
hurt
.

But
this
case
is
a
stark
lesson
in
how
the
failures
of
the
traditional
policy-making
process
have
left
the
courts
as
the
only
forum

this
country
has
to
debate
risk
,
technology
and
innovation
.

Too
often
now
,
a
single
court
decision
becomes
the
precedent
for
other
,
less
compelling
cases
.

From
the
1940s
until
1971
,
some
two
million
women
took
the
synthetic
hormone
diethylstilbestrol
(
DES
)
to
prevent
miscarriages
and
morning
sickness
.

The
drug
was
approved
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
and
marketed
by
some
300
pharmaceutical
companies
,
often
under
generic
labels
.

In
the
1970s
,
scientists
reported
cancer
cases
among
the
daughters
of
DES
users
.

The
cases
quickly
went
to
court
,
but
the
mothers
of
several
thousand
DES
plaintiffs
could
n't
recall
whose
brand

they
used
.

Beginning
in
1980
,
courts
in
several
states
including
California
and
New
York
decided
to
suspend
the
common-law
rule
that
plaintiffs
must
prove
that
the
defendants
are
the
ones

who
are
liable
.

Courts
made
the
assumption
that
all
DES
pills
were
essentially
the
same
,
and
created
a
market-share
test
so
that
damages
would
be
assessed
against
drug
makers
in
the
proportion
of
their
share
of
the
original
sales
.

This
has
some
logic
.

Drug
makers
should
n't
be
able
to
duck
liability
because
people
could
n't
identify
precisely
which

identical
drug
was
used
.

But
courts
quickly
tumbled
down
a
slippery
slope
.

Just
as
all
plaintiffs
are
not
alike
,
it
turns
out
that
DES
defendants
marketed
the
drugs
differently
and
may
have
offered
different
warranties
.

The
ultimate
result
came
in
Hymowitz
v.
Lilly
,
where
the
highest
New
York
court
expanded
the
market-share
approach
for
the
first
time
to
say
that
drug
makers

that
could
prove
Mindy
Hymowitz
's
mother
did
n't
use
their
pill
must
still
pay
their
share
of
any
damages
.

But
as
Duke
University
law
professor
William
Van
Alstyne
notes
,
by
this
reasoning

a
defendant
could
be
held
liable
in
New
York
for
a
bad
apple
even
if
he
sold
all
his
apples
in
California
.

Despite
the
Supreme
Court
's
refusal
to
hear
the
case
,
there
are
serious
constitutional
issues
of
due
process
and
uncompensated
takings
from
the
defendants
.

The
big
problem
,
however
,
is
that
there
's
no
guarantee
that
this
reasoning
will
be
limited
to
DES
or
to
drugs
.

The
problem
here
goes
well
beyond
twisting
legal
doctrine
.

The
California
Supreme
Court
last
year
reversed
direction
to
make
it
much
harder
to
win
DES
cases
because
the
justices
saw
how
all
the
pharmaceutical
litigation
has
chilled
the
introduction
of
new
drugs
.

The
court
rejected
strict
liability
for
prescription
drugs
,
citing
the
huge
,
hidden
social
costs
.

``
Public
policy
favors
the
development
and
marketing
of
beneficial
new
drugs
,
even
though
some
risks
,
perhaps
serious
ones
,
might
accompany
their
introduction
because
drugs
can
save
lives
and
reduce
pain
and
suffering
,
''
the
unanimous
court
said
.

The
California
justices
noted
that
the
fear
of
litigation
already
forced
the
only
remaining
anti-morning-sickness
drug
,
Bendectin
,
off
the
U.S.
market
.

This
raises
the
key
issue
:
What
to
do
about
people

who
suffer
serious
injuries
from
beneficial
drugs
?

We
now
know
that
holding
drug
makers
liable
where
there
's
no
evidence
that
they
or
anyone
else
knew
of
any
risks
only
means
the
drugs
wo
n't
be
available
to
anyone
.

As
liability
expert
Peter
Huber
tells
us
,
after
the
Hymowitz
case
,
if
any
drug
maker
introduces
an
anti-miscarriage
drug
``
it
's
time
to
sell
that
company
's
stock
short
.

''
We
also
know
that
the
tort
system
is
a
lousy
way
to
compensate
victims
anyway
;
some
win
the
legal
lottery
,
others
get
much
less
and
contingency-fee
lawyers
take
a
big
cut
either
way
.

DES
daughters
and
other
victims
of
drugs
would
be
better
off
if
their
cases
were
taken
out
of
the
courts
.

Congress
could
create
a
compensation
program
to
help
such
victims
while
protecting
the
national
interest
in
encouraging
new
drugs
.

But
a
1986
law

that
supposedly
replaced
lawsuits
over
children
's
vaccines
with
a
compensation
fund
has
predictably
led
to
even
more
litigation
.

Everyone
by
now
understands
that
Congress
is
utterly
incapable
of
writing
legislation
to
help
deserving
people
without
its
becoming
some
billion-dollar
morass
.

We
have
no
doubt

this
is
one
reason
judges
in
New
York
and
justices
on
the
Supreme
Court
are
willing
to
trash
the
law
in
the
DES
cases
.

They
must
figure
that
justice
has
to
get
done
by
somebody
,
but
know
it
wo
n't
be
done
by
Congress
.

William
C.
Walbrecher
Jr.
,
an
executive
at
San
Francisco-based
1st
Nationwide
Bank
,
was
named
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Citadel
Holding
Corp.
and
its
principal
operating
unit
,
Fidelity
Federal
Bank
.

The
appointment
takes
effect
Nov.
13
.

He
succeeds
James
A.
Taylor
,
who
stepped
down
as
chairman
,
president
and
chief
executive
in
March
for
health
reasons
.

Edward
L.
Kane
succeeded
Mr.
Taylor
as
chairman
.

Separately
,
Citadel
posted
a
third-quarter
net
loss
of
$
2.3
million
,
or
68
cents

a
share
,
versus
net
income
of
$
5.3
million
,
or
$
1.61

a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

The
latest
results
include
some
unusual
write-downs
,
which
had
an
after-tax
impact
of
$
4.9
million
.

Those
included
costs
associated
with
the
potential
Valley
Federal
Savings
and
Loan
Association
acquisition
,
which
was
terminated
on
Sept.
27
,
1989
.

In
addition
,
operating
results
were
hit
by
an
increase
in
loan
and
real
estate
loss
reserves
.

In
American
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
,
Citadel
shares
closed
yesterday
at
$
45.75
,
down
25
cents
.

Hadson
Corp.
said
it
expects
to
report
a
third-quarter
net
loss
of
$
17
million
to
$
19
million
because
of
special
reserves
and
continued
low
natural-gas
prices
.

The
Oklahoma
City
energy
and
defense
concern
said
it
will
record
a
$
7.5
million
reserve
for
its
defense
group
,
including
a
$
4.7
million
charge
related
to
problems
under
a
fixed-price
development
contract
and
$
2.8
million
in
overhead
costs

that
wo
n't
be
reimbursed
.

In
addition
,
Hadson
said
it
will
write
off
about
$
3.5
million
in
costs
related
to
international
exploration
leases
where
exploration
efforts
have
been
unsuccessful
.

The
company
also
cited
interest
costs
and
amortization
of
goodwill
as
factors
in
the
loss
.

A
year
earlier
,
net
income
was
$
2.1
million
,
or
six
cents

a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
169.9
million

The
Bush
administration
's
nomination
of
Clarence
Thomas
to
a
seat
on
the
federal
appeals
court
here
received
a
blow

this
week
when
the
American
Bar
Association
gave
Mr.
Thomas
only
a
``
qualified
''
rating
,
rather
than
``
well
qualified
.

''

People
familiar
with
the
Senate
Judiciary
Committee
,
which
will
vote
on
the
nomination
,
said
some
liberal
members
of
the
panel
are
likely
to
question
the
ABA
rating
in
hearings
on
the
matter
.

Mr.
Thomas
,
currently
chairman
of
the
Equal
Employment
Opportunity
Commission
,
would
add
another
conservative
voice
to
the
closely
divided
court
.

Groups
have
accused
him
of
advocating
policies

that
narrowed
rights
of
older
workers
and
of
ignoring
discrimination
by
large
companies
.

Fourteen
members
of
the
House
with
jurisdiction
over
the
EEOC
have
said
they
oppose
Mr.
Thomas
's
nomination
because
of
``
serious
questions
about
his
judgment
{
and
}
respect
for
the
law
.

''

A
senior
Justice
Department
official
,
however
,
said
the
administration
is
n't
worried
about
the
ABA
rating
.

``
We
're
pleased
the
ABA
rated
him
qualified
,
''
David
Runkel
,
the
department
's
chief
spokesman
,
said
in
an
interview
.

The
ABA
gives
a
``
qualified
''
rating
to
nominees

it
believes
would
perform
``
satisfactorily
''
on
the
bench
.

In
contrast
,
the
lawyers
'
association
gives
a
``
well
qualified
''
rating
to
those
``
regarded
as
one
of
the
best
available
for
the
vacancy
.

Reuters
Holdings
PLC
said
Michael
Reupke
resigned
as
general
manager
to
pursue
unspecified
interests
,
a
move

the
news
organization
termed
an
``
amicable
separation
.

''

Mr.
Reupke
,
52
years
old
and
a
27-year
Reuters
veteran
,
had
been
the
information-services
company
's
general
manager
for
only
six
months
.

His
appointment
to
that
post
,
which
has
senior
administrative
,
staff
and
policy
responsibilities
,
followed
a
several-year
tenure
as
Reuters
's
editor
in
chief
.

No
successor
was
named
,
and
Mr.
Reupke
's
duties
will
be
split
among
three
other
senior
Reuters
executives
,
the
company
said
.

In
a
telephone
interview
,
Mr.
Reupke
said
his
departure
was
for
``
personal
reasons
,
''
which

he
declined
to
specify
.

``
There
is
no
business
reason
for
my
departure
,
''
nor
any
disagreement
over
policy
,
he
added
.

He
also
rejected
reports
that
his
departure
stemmed
from
disappointment

the
general
manager
's
post
had
n't
also
led
to
a
board
directorship
at
the
London-based
news
organization
.

Mr.
Reupke
was
one
of
three
executives
on
Reuters
's
eight-person
executive
committee

who
did
n't
also
serve
on
the
company
's
board
of
directors
.

``
If
I
were
choosing
the
people
of
tomorrow
,
I
would
have
chosen
the
people

who
are
now
on
the
board
,
''
he
said
.

A
Reuters
spokesman
said
the
departure
reflects
``
no
change
in
strategy
or
profits
.

''
Mark
Shepperd
,
an
analyst
at
UBS
Phillips
&
Drew
in
London
,
said
,
``
I
suspect
(
the
departure
)
will
be
fairly
irrelevant
for
the
company
.

I
would
be
very
surprised
if
his
departure
signals
any
change
in
strategy
or
change
in
profit
expectations
.

New
York
financier
Saul
Steinberg
sought
federal
permission
to
buy
more
than
15
%
of
United
Airlines
'
parent
,
UAL
Corp.
,
saying
he
might
seek
control
of
the
nation
's
second-largest
airline
.

Although
takeover
experts
said
they
doubted
Mr.
Steinberg
will
make
a
bid
by
himself
,
the
application
by
his
Reliance
Group
Holdings
Inc.
could
signal
his
interest
in
helping
revive
a
failed
labor-management
bid
.

Such
an
application
for
federal
antitrust
clearance
is
necessary
for
any
investor

that
might
seek
control
.

But
some
investors
have
used
such
filings
to
boost
the
value
of
their
stock
holdings
,
which
--
without
buying
more
stock
--
they
then
sold
.

Takeover
stock
traders
were
puzzled
by
the
Reliance
filing
and
cautioned
that
it
does
n't
mean
Mr.
Steinberg
will
definitely
seek
control
.

``
Maybe
he
just
wants
to
make
something
happen
,
''
said
one
takeover
expert
.

One
investment
banker
said
Mr.
Steinberg
may
be
trying
to
position
himself
as
a
friendly
investor

who
could
help
UAL
Chairman
Stephen
Wolf
revive
a
failed
labor-management
bid
.

Mr.
Steinberg
,
he
suggested
,
could
replace
British
Airways
PLC
,
which
has
withdrawn
from
the
buy-out
group
.

Reliance
had
already
bought
and
sold
UAL
stock
at
a
big
profit
without
making
an
antitrust
filing
before
the
collapse
Oct.
13
of
the
$
6.79
billion
,
$
300-a-share
labor-management
buy-out
.

Reliance
acquired
a
7
%
UAL
stake
early
this
year
at
an
average
cost
of
$
110

a
share
,
and
reduced
its
stake
to
4.7
%
after
UAL
accepted
the
bid
at
prices
higher
than
$
282

a
share
.

Market
sources
said
Reliance
has
already
sold
its
entire
UAL
stake
,
and
thus
would
n't
have
any
reason
to
file
the
application
simply
to
boost
the
value
of
its
stock
.

But
the
exact
amount
of
Reliance
's
current
holding
has
n't
been
formally
disclosed
.

The
filing
adds
a
new
twist
to
market
speculation
that
Coniston
Partners
,
a
New
York
money
manager
,
has
bought
more
than
5
%
of
UAL
stock
and
may
challenge
the
UAL
board
's
decision
last
week
to
remain
independent
.

Speculation
about
Coniston
has
caused
the
stock
to
rebound
from
a
low
of
$
145
.

UAL
's
announcement
came
after
the
market
closed
yesterday
.

In
composite
New
York
Stock
Exchange
trading
,
the
shares
closed
at
$
177
,
up
$
1.50
.

UAL
would
n't
elaborate
on
a
statement
that
it
had
been
notified
of
the
filing
by
Reliance
.

Reliance
confirmed
the
filing
but
would
n't
elaborate
.

Some
takeover
experts
were
skeptical
,
saying
it
was
possible
that
Mr.
Steinberg
made
the
filing
only
to
help
boost
the
value
of
any

remaining
Reliance
stake
in
UAL
.

Mr.
Steinberg
is
thought
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
UAL
's
Mr.
Wolf
.

The
investor
was
instrumental
in
tapping
Mr.
Wolf
to
run
the
air
cargo
unit
of
Tiger
International
Inc
.

Mr.
Wolf
's
success
in
that
job
helped
him
land
the
top
job
with
UAL
in
December
1987
.

But
any
potential
acquirer
must
attempt
to
reach
some
kind
of
accord
with
the
company
's
employees
,
primarily
its
pilots
and
the
powerful
machinists
'
union
,
which
has
opposed
a
takeover
.

``
The

Some
Democrats
in
Congress
are
warning
that
a
complicated
new
funding
device
for
the
two
federal
antitrust
agencies
could
result
in
further
cutbacks
in
a
regulatory
area
already
reduced
sharply
in
recent
years
.

The
funding
mechanism
,
which
has
received
congressional
approval
and
is
expected
to
be
signed
by
President
Bush
,
would
affect
the
antitrust
operations
of
the
Justice
Department
and
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
.

As
a
part
of
overall
efforts
to
reduce
spending
,
Congress
cut
by
$
30
million

the
Bush
administration
's
request
for
antitrust
enforcement
for
fiscal
1990
,
which
began
Oct.
1
.

To
offset
the
reduction
,
Congress
approved
a
$
20,000
fee
that
investors
and
companies
will
have
to
pay
each
time

they
make
required
filings
to
antitrust
regulators
about
mergers
,
acquisitions
and
certain
other
transactions
.

Some
Democrats
,
led
by
Rep.
Jack
Brooks
(
D.
,
Texas
)
,
unsuccessfully
opposed
the
measure
because
they
fear
that
the
fees
may
not
fully
make
up
for
the
budget
cuts
.

But
Justice
Department
and
FTC
officials
said
they
expect
the
filing
fees
to
make
up
for
the
budget
reductions
and
possibly
exceed
them
.

``
It
could
operate
to
augment
our
budget
,
''
James
Rill
,
the
Justice
Department
's
antitrust
chief
,
said
in
an
interview
.

Under
measures
approved
by
both

houses
of
Congress
,
the
administration
's
request
for
$
47
million
for
the
Antitrust
Division
would
be
cut
$
15
million
.

The
FTC
budget
request
of
$
70
million
,
about
$
34
million
of
which
would
go
for
antitrust
enforcement
,
would
also
be
cut
by
$
15
million
.

The
administration
had
requested
roughly
the
same
amount
for
antitrust
enforcement
for
fiscal
1990
as
was
appropriated
in
fiscal
1989
.

The
offsetting
fees
would
apply
to
filings
made
under
the
Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act
.

Under
that
law
,
parties
proposing
mergers
or
acquisitions
valued
at
$
15
million
or
more
must
notify
FTC
and
Justice
Department
antitrust
regulators
before
completing
the
transactions
.

Currently
,
the
government
charges
nothing
for
such
filings
.

Proponents
of
the
funding
arrangement
predict
that
,
based
on
recent
filing
levels
of
more
than
2,000

a
year
,
the
fees
will
yield
at
least
$
40
million
this
fiscal
year
,
or
$
10
million
more
than
the
budget
cuts
.

``
When
you
do
that
,
there
is
not
a
cut
,
but
there
is
in
fact

a
program
increase
of
$
5
million
''
each
for
the
FTC
and
the
Justice
Department
,
Rep.
Neal
Smith
(
D.
,
Iowa
)
said
during
House
debate
.

But
Rep.
Don
Edwards
(
D.
,
Calif
.

)
responded
that
a
recession
could
stifle
merger
activity
,
reducing
the
amount
of
fees
collected
.

The
antitrust
staffs
of
both

the
FTC
and
Justice
Department
were
cut
more
than
40
%
in
the
Reagan
administration
,
and
enforcement
of
major
merger
cases
fell
off
drastically
during
that
period
.

``
Today
is
not
the
time
to
signal
that
Congress
in
any
way
sanctions
the
dismal
state
into
which

antitrust
enforcement
has
fallen
,
''
Mr.
Edwards
argued
.

Any
money
in
excess
of
$
40
million
collected
from
the
fees
in
fiscal
1990
would
go
to
the
Treasury
at
large
.

Corporate
lawyers
said
the
new
fees
would
n't
inhibit
many
mergers
or
other
transactions
.

Though
some
lawyers
reported
that
prospective
acquirers
were
scrambling
to
make
filings
before
the
fees
take
effect
,
government
officials
said
they
had
n't
noticed
any
surge
in
filings
.

R.
Gordon
McGovern
was
forced
out
as
Campbell
Soup
Co.
's
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
the
strongest
evidence
yet
of
the
power

that
Dorrance
family
members
intend
to
wield
in
reshaping
the
troubled
food
company
.

Herbert
M.
Baum
,
the
53-year-old
president
of
the
company
's
Campbell
U.S.A.
unit
,
and
Edwin
L.
Harper
,
47
,
the
chief
financial
officer
,
will
run
Campbell
as
a
team
,
dividing
responsibilities
rather
evenly
until
a
successor
is
named
.

The
board
already
has
been
searching
for
strong
outside
candidates
,
including
food-industry
executives
with
considerable
international
experience
.

Wall
Street
reacted
favorably
to
Mr.
McGovern
's
departure
and
its
implications
.

In
heavy
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
Campbell
's
shares
rose
$
3.375
to
close
at
$
47.125
.

``
The
profit
motive
of
the
major
shareholders
has
clearly
changed
for
the
better
,
''
said
John
McMillin
,
a
food
industry
analyst
for
Prudential-Bache
in
New
York
.

Mr.
McGovern
was
widely
seen
as
sales
,
and
not
profit
,
oriented
.

``
New
managers
would
think
a
little
more
like
Wall
Street
,
''
Mr.
McMillin
added
.

Some
of
the
surge
in
the
stock
's
price
appeared
to
be
linked
to
revived
takeover
speculation
,
which
has
contributed
to
volatility
of
Campbell
shares
in
recent
months
.

Campbell
's
international
businesses
,
particularly
in
the
U.K.
and
Italy
,
appear
to
be
at
the
heart
of
its
problems
.

Growth
has
fallen
short
of
targets
and
operating
earnings
are
far
below
results
in
U.S.
units
.

For
example
,
Campbell
is
a
distant
third
in
the
U.K.
frozen
foods
market
,
where
it
recently
paid
24
times
earnings
for
Freshbake
Foods
PLC
and
wound
up
with
far
more
capacity
than
it
could
use
.

Similarly
,
Campbell
's
Italian
biscuit
operation
,
D.
Lazzaroni
&
Co.
,
has
been
hurt
by
overproduction
and
distribution
problems
.

Such
problems
will
require
considerable
skill
to
resolve
.

However
,
neither
Mr.
Baum
nor
Mr.
Harper
has
much
international
experience
.

Mr.
Baum
,
a
seasoned
marketer

who
is
said
to
have
a
good
rapport
with
Campbell
employees
,
will
have
responsibility
for
all
domestic
operations
except
the
Pepperidge
Farm
unit
.

Mr.
Harper
,
a
veteran
of
several
manufacturing
companies

who
joined
Campbell
in
1986
,
will
take
charge
of
all
overseas
operations
as
well
as
Pepperidge
.

In
an
joint
interview
yesterday
,
both

men
said
they
would
like
to
be
the
company
's
next
chief
executive
.

Mr.
McGovern
,
63
,
had
been
under
intense
pressure
from
the
board
to
boost
Campbell
's
mediocre
performance
to
the
level
of
other
food
companies
.

The
board
is
dominated
by
the
heirs
of
the
late
John
T.
Dorrance
Jr.
,
who
controlled
about
58
%
of
Campbell
's
stock
when
he
died
in
April
.

In
recent
months
,
Mr.
Dorrance
's
children
and
other
family
members
have
pushed
for
improved
profitability
and
higher
returns
on
their
equity
.

In
August
,
the
company
took
a
$
343
million
pretax
charge
against
fiscal
1989
earnings
when
it
announced
a
world-wide
restructuring
plan
.

The
plan
calls
for
closing
at
least
nine
plants
and
eliminating
about
3,600
jobs
.

But
analysts
said
early
results
from
the
reorganization
have
been
disappointing
,
especially
in
Europe
,
and
there
were
signs
that
the
board
became
impatient
.

Campbell
officials
said
Mr.
McGovern
was
n't
available
yesterday
to
discuss
the
circumstances
of
his
departure
.

The
company
's
prepared
statement
quoted
him
as
saying
,
``
The
CEO
succession
is
well
along
and
I
've
decided
for
personal
reasons
to
take
early
retirement
.

''

But
people
familiar
with
the
agenda
of
the
board
's
meeting
last
week
in
London
said
Mr.
McGovern
was
fired
.

Mr.
McGovern
himself
had
said
repeatedly
that
he
intended
to
stay
on
until
he
reached
the
conventional
retirement
age
of
65
in
October
1991
,
``
unless
I
get
fired
.

''
Campbell
said
Mr.
McGovern
had
withdrawn
his
name
as
a
candidate
for
re-election
as
a
director
at
the
annual
shareholder
meeting
,
scheduled
for
Nov.
17
.

For
fiscal
1989
,
Mr.
McGovern
received
a
salary
of
$
877,663
.

He
owns
about
45,000
shares
of
Campbell
stock
and
has
options
to
buy
more
than
100,000
additional
shares
.

He
will
be
eligible
for
an
annual
pension
of
more
than
$
244,000
with
certain
other
fringe
benefits
.

During
Mr.
McGovern
's
nine-year
term
as
president
,
the
company
's
sales
rose
to
$
5.7
billion
from
$
2.8
billion
and
net
income
increased
to
$
274
million
from
$
130
million
,
the
statement
said
.

Mr.
Baum
said
he
and
Mr.
Harper

both
advocated
closing
some
plants
as
long
ago
as
early
1988
.

``
You
've
got
to
make
the
restructuring
work
,
''
said
Mr.
Baum
.

``
You
've
got
to
make
those
savings
now
.

''

Mr.
Harper
expressed
confidence
that
he
and
Mr.
Baum
can
convince
the
board
of
their
worthiness
to
run
the
company
.

``
We
look
upon
this
as
a
great
opportunity
to
prove
the
fact
that
we
have
a
tremendous
management
team
,
''
he
said
.

He
predicted
that
the
board
would
give
the
current
duo
until
early
next
year
before
naming
a
new
chief
executive
.

Mr.
Baum
said
the
two
have
orders
to
``
focus
on
bottom-line
profits
''
and
to
``
take
a
hard
look
at
our
businesses
--
what
is
good
,
what
is
not
so
good
.

''
Analysts
generally
applaud
the
performance
of
Campbell
U.S.A.
,
the
company
's
largest
division
,
which
posted
6
%
unit
sales
growth
and
a
15
%
improvement
in
operating
profit
for
fiscal
1989
.

``
The
way
that
we
've
been
managing
Campbell
U.S.A.
can
hopefully
spread
to
other
areas
of
the
company
,
''
Mr.
Baum
said
.

In
the
interview
at
headquarters
yesterday
afternoon
,
both

men
exuded
confidence
and
seemed
to
work
well
together
.

``
You
've
got
two
champions
sitting
right
before
you
,
''
said
Mr.
Baum
.

``
We
play
to
win
.

Mich.-based
First

America
said
it
will
eliminate
the

First

First

But
it
said
that
severance

reduce
First

Heritage
Media

said
it
offered
to
buy
the

of
POP
Radio
Corp.
it

own
in
a

.

Heritage
,
which
owns
51
%
of
POP

3.6

said
it
will
exchange
one
share
of
a
new
preferred

for
each
POP

.

Depending
upon
how
many
warrants
and

are
exercised
prior

,
Heritage
would
issue
between
1.8

Oshkosh
Truck
Corp.
,
Oshkosh
,
Wis.
,
estimated
earnings
for
its
fourth
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
fell
50
%
to
75
%
below
the
year-earlier
$
4.5
million
,
or
51
cents

a
share
.

The
truck
maker
said
the
significant
drop
in
net
income
will
result
in
lower
earnings
for
the
fiscal
year
.

In
fiscal
1988
,
the
company
earned
$
17.3
million
,
or
$
1.92

a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
352.9
million
.

Oshkosh
Truck
attributed
the
downturn
in
its
earnings
to
higher
start-up
costs
of
its
new
chassis
division
,
a
softer
motor-home
market
and
higher
administrative
costs
of
compliance
with
government
contractor
regulations
.

The
company
said
it
is
in
the
process
of
phasing
out
John
Deere
,
its
current
source
of
production
for
midsized
motor
home
chassis
.

In
anticipation
of
the
start-up
of
its
new
factory
,
the
company
said
a
larger-than-normal
chassis
supply
has
been
built
to
carry
it
through
the
transition
period
.

The
United
Kingdom
High
Court
declared
illegal
a
variety
of
interest-rate
swap
transactions
and
options
deals
between
a
London
borough
council
and
commercial
banks
.

The
ruling
could
lead
to
the
cancellation
of
huge
bank
debts

the
London
Borough
of
Hammersmith
and
Fulham
ran
up
after
losing
heavily
on
swap
transactions
.

As
many
as
70
U.K.
and
international
banks
stand
to
lose
several
hundred
million
pounds
should
the
decision
be
upheld
and
set
a
precedent
for
other
municipalities
.

An
appeal
is
expected
.

In
response
to
the
ruling
,
gilt
futures
swiftly
plunged
more
than
a
point
yesterday
before
recovering
much
of
the
loss
by
the
end
of
the
session
.

Gilts
,
or
British
government
bonds
,
which
also
fell
sharply
initially
,
retraced
some
of
the
losses
to
end
about
point
lower
.

The
council
,
which
is
alleged
to
have
engaged
in
over
600
deals
valued
at
over
#
6
billion
(
$
9.5
billion
)
,
lost
millions
of
pounds
from
soured
swap
deals
.

At
one
point
,
Hammersmith
is
reported
to
have
accounted
for
as
much
as
10
%
of
the
sterling
market
in
interest-rate
swap
dealings
.

When
two
parties
engage
in
an
interest-rate
swap
,
they
are
betting
against
each
other
on
future
rates
.

Thus
,
an
institution
obligated
to
make
fixed-rate
interest
payments
on
debt
swaps
the
payments
with
another
making
floating-rate
payments
.

In
most
of
the
British
transactions
,
the
municipalities
agreed
to
make
floating-rate
payments
to
banks
,
which
would
make
fixed-rate
payments
.

As
interest
rates
rose
,
municipalities
owed
the
banks
more
than
the
banks
were
paying
them
.

The
court
hearing
began
in
early
October
at
the
request
of
Anthony
Hazell
,
district
auditor
for
Hammersmith
,
who
argued
that
local
councils
are
n't
vested
with
constitutional
authority
to
engage
in
such
capital-markets
activities
.

The
council
backed
the
audit
commission
's
stand
that
the
swap
transactions
are
illegal
.

Although
the
Hammersmith
and
Fulham
council
was
by
far
the
most
active
local
authority
engaging
in
such
capital-markets
transactions
,
the
court
decision
could
set
a
precedent
for
similar
transactions
by
77
other
local
councils
.

``
While
this
court
ruling
was
only
on
Hammersmith
,
it
will
obviously
be
very
persuasive
in
other
cases
of
a
similar
nature
,
''
a
solicitor
representing
one
of
the
banks
said
.

Already
,
10
local
councils
have
refused
to
honor
fees
and
payments
to
banks
incurred
during
various
swaps
dealings
.

Other
financial
institutions
involved
include
Barclays
Bank
PLC
,
Midland
Bank
PLC
,
Security
Pacific
Corp.
,
Chemical
Banking
Corp.
's
Chemical
Bank
,
Citicorp
's
Citibank
and
Mitsubishi
Finance
International
.

If
the
banks
exhaust
all
avenues
of
appeal
,
it
is
possible
that
they
would
seek
to
have
the
illegality
ruling
work
both

ways
,
some
market
sources
said
.

Banks
could
seek
to
recover
payments
to
local
authorities
in
instances
where
the
banks
made
net
payments
to
councils
.

Officials
from
the
various
banks
involved
are
expected
to
meet
during
the
next
few
days
to
consider
other
arrangements
with
local
authorities

that
could
be
questionable
.

The
banks
have
28
days
to
file
an
appeal
against
the
ruling
and
are
expected
to
do
so
shortly
.

The
parent
of
Younkers
,
after
failing
to
find
a
buyer
for
the
chain
of
Midwestern
department
stores
,
said
it
will
sell
a
stake
in
the
chain
to
management
and
take
other
steps
to
reduce
its
investment
in
retailing
.

Equitable
of
Iowa
Cos.
,
Des
Moines
,
had
been
seeking
a
buyer
for
the
36-store
Younkers
chain
since
June
,
when
it
announced
its
intention
to
free
up
capital
to
expand
its
insurance
business
.

But
Equitable
said
it
was
unable
to
find
a
buyer
willing
to
pay
what

it
considers
``
fair
value
''
for
Younkers
because
of
recent
turmoil
in
the
bond
and
stock
markets
and
in
retailing
.

Younkers
rang
up
sales
in
1988
of
$
313
million
.

It
operates
stores
mostly
in
Iowa
and
Nebraska
.

Younkers
management
is
likely
to
buy
a
10
%
to
20
%
interest
in
the
chain
in
January
,
said
Fred
S.
Hubbell
,
Equitable
's
president
and
chief
executive
officer
.

He
said
Equitable
hopes
to
eventually
reduce
its
stake
in
Younkers
to
less
than
50
%
.

FALL
BALLOT
ISSUES
set
a
record
for
off-year
elections
.

Odd-year
elections
attract
relatively
few
ballot
issues
.

But
the
1989
fall
total
of
80
,
while
well
below
1988
activity
,
shows
``
a
steady
ratcheting
up
in
citizen
referenda
and
initiatives
,
''
says
Patrick
McGuigan
,
editor
of
Family
,
Law
and
Democracy
Report
.

He
says
the
10
citizen-sparked
issues
on
state
ballots

this
fall
represent
the
most
in
any
odd-year

this
decade
.

Ballot
questions
range
from
a
Maine
initiative
on
banning
Cruise
missiles
to
a
referendum
on
increasing
the
North
Dakota
income
tax
.

Ballot
watchers
say
attention
already
is
focused
on
the
1990
elections
.

In
California
,
two
petition
drives
for
next
year
's
election
are
``
essentially
finished
,
''
says
David
Schmidt
,
author
of
``
Citizen
Lawmakers
.

''
Mr.
McGuigan
cites
three
completed
efforts
in
Oklahoma
.

Hot
ballot
topics
are
expected
to
be
abortion
,
the
environment
and
insurance
reform
.

Taking
a
cue
from
California
,
more
politicians
will
launch
their
campaigns
by
backing
initiatives
,
says
David
Magleby
of
Brigham

University

PHOTOGRAPH
COLLECTING

new
stature
as

of
21

from
Alfred
Stieglitz
's
``

series
sold
for

396,000
,
a
single-lot
record
.

Other
works
also
have
been
exceeding
price
estimates
.

In
part
,
prices
reflect
development
of
a
market
structure
based
on
such
variables
as
the
number
of
prints
.

This
information
used
to
be
poorly
documented
and
largely
anecdotal
,
says
Beth
Gates-Warren
of
Sotheby
's
.

``
There
is
finally
some
sort
of
sense
in
the
market
,
''
she
says
.

Corporations
and
museums
are
among
the
serious
buyers
,
giving
greater
market
stability
,
says
Robert
Persky
of
the
Photograph
Collector
.

``
When
I
see
prints
going
into
the
hands
of
institutions
,
I
know
they
are
n't
going

come
back

the
market
.

''
Most
in
demand
:
classic
photographs
by
masters
such
as

DIALING
900
brings
callers

a
growing
number
of
services
.

Currently
a
$
300
million-a-year
business
,
900
telephone
service
is
expected
to
hit
$
500
million
next
year
and
near
$
2
billion
by
1992
as
uses
for
the
service
continue
to
expand
,
says
Joel
Gross
of
Donaldson

The
service
--
which
costs
the
caller
from
30
cents
to
$
25

a
minute
--
currently
is
dominated
by
celebrity
chatter
,
horoscopes
and
romance
lines
.

But
more
serious
applications
are
in
the
wings
,
and
that
is
where
the
future
growth
is
expected
.

``
I
'm
starting
to
see
more
business
transactions
,
''
says
Andrea
West
of
American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
Co.
,
noting
growing
interest
in
use
of
900
service
for
stock
sales
,
software
tutorials
and
even
service
contracts
.

Colleges
,
she
says
,
are
eyeing
registration
through
900
service
.

Charities
test
the
waters
,
but
they
face
legal
barriers
to
electronic
fund
raising
.

``
The
thing

that
will
really
break
this
market
right
open
is
merchandising
,
''
Ms.
West
says
.

Much
of
the

Research

The
House
passed
legislation
designed
to
make
it
easier
for
the
Transportation
Department
to
block
airline
leveraged
buy-outs
.

The
final
vote
came
after
the
House
rejected
Republican
efforts
to
weaken
the
bill
and
approved
two
amendments
sought
by
organized
labor
.

The
Bush
administration
has
threatened
to
veto
such
a
bill
because
of
what

it
views
as
an
undesirable
intrusion
into
the
affairs
of
industry
,
but
the
300-113
vote
suggests
that
supporters
have
the
potential
to
override
a
veto
.

The
broader
question
is
where
the
Senate
stands
on
the
issue
.

While
the
Senate
Commerce
Committee
has
approved
legislation
similar
to
the
House
bill
on
airline
leveraged
buy-outs
,
the
measure
has
n't
yet
come
to
the
full
floor
.

Although
the
legislation
would
apply
to
acquisitions
involving
any
major
airline
,
it
is
aimed
at
giving
the
Transportation
Department

the
chance
to
review
in
advance
transactions
financed
by
large
amounts
of
debt
.

``
The
purpose
of
the
bill
is
to
put
the
brakes
on
airline
acquisitions

that
would
so
load
a
carrier
up
with
debt
that
it
would
impede
safety
or
a
carrier
's
ability
to
compete
,
''
Rep.
John
Paul
Hammerschmidt
,
(
R.
,
Ark
.

)
said
.

The
bill
,
as
it
was
approved
by
the
House
Public
Works
and
Transportation
Committee
,
would
give
the
Transportation
Department
up
to
50
days
to
review
any
purchase
of
15
%
or
more
of
the
stock
in
an
airline
.

The
department
would
be
required
to
block
the
buy-out
if
the
acquisition
is
likely
to
financially
weaken
a
carrier
so
that
safety
would
be
impaired
;
its
ability
to
compete
would
be
sharply
diminished
;
it
would
be
put
into
foreign
control
;
or
if
the
transaction
would
result
in
the
sale
of
airline-related
assets
--
unless
selling
such
assets
had
an
overriding
public
benefit
.

The
House
approved
an
amendment
offered
by
Rep.

would
,
in
addition
to
the
previous
criteria
,
also
require
the
department
to
block
the
acquisition
of
an
airline
if
the
added
debt
incurred
were
likely
to
result
in
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
the
carrier
's
employees
,
or
their
wages
or
benefits
.

Rep.
James
Traficant
(
D.
,
Ohio
)
,
said
the
amendment
,
which
passed
271-147
,
would
``
let
the
American
worker
know
that
we
consider
them
occasionally
.

''
But
Rep.
Hammerschmidt
said
that
the
provision
,
which

he
dubbed
a
``
special
interest
''
amendment
,
was
likely
to
make
the
bill
even
more
controversial
.

On
Tuesday
,
the
House
approved
a
labor-backed
amendment

that
would
require
the
Transportation
Department
to
reject
airline
acquisitions
if
the
person
seeking
to
purchase
a
carrier
had
run
two
or
more
airlines
previously
that
have
filed
for
protection
from
creditors
under
Chapter
11
of
the
federal
Bankruptcy
Code
.

The
provision
,
called
the
``
two-time-losers
''
amendment
by
its
supporters
,
apparently
was
aimed
at
preventing
Texas
Air
Corp.
Chairman
Frank
Lorenzo
from
attempting
to
take
over
another
airline
.

Tony
Lama
Co.
said
that
Equus
Investment
II
Limited
Partnership
has
proposed
changing
the
offer
for
the
company
to
$
13.65
in
cash
and
stock
from
an
all-cash
transaction
.

Under
terms
of
the
new
proposal
,
Equus
,
managed
by
Equus
Capital
Corp.
,
Houston
,
would
pay
$
12
cash
and
one
new
preferred
share
with
a
liquidation
preference
of
$
1.65

a
share
for
each
of
Tony
Lama
's
2.1
million
shares
outstanding
.

Previously
,
it
offered
$
13.65

a
share
in
cash
,
or
$
29
million
.

The
El
Paso
,
Texas
,
maker
of
Western
boots
and
leather
accessories
said
the
preferred
stock
would
accrue
dividends
at
a
12
%
rate
,
but
would
n't
be
paid
for
the
first
two
years
.

The
stock
would
be
redeemed
in
five
years
,
subject
to
terms
of
the
surviving
company
's
debt
.

Neither
Equus
nor
Tony
Lama
gave
a
reason
for
the
changed
offer
and
Tony
Lama
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

However
,
Tony
Lama
said
it
would
promptly
submit
the
offer
to
a
special
committee
of
the
company
's
board
.

Savin
Corp.
reported
a
third-quarter
net
loss
of
$
35.2
million
,
or
31
cents

a
share
,
compared
with
year-earlier
profit
of
$
3.8
million
,
or
one
cent

a
share
.

A
spokesman
for
the
Stamford
,
Conn.based
company
said
operations
had
a
loss
of
$
5.5
million
for
the
quarter
;
in
addition
,
the
loss
was
magnified
by
nonrecurring
charges
totaling
$
23.5
million
and
$
8.2
million
in
asset-valuation
adjustments
that
he
described
as
``
unusual
.

''
The
charges
were
partly
offset
by
a
$
2
million
gain
on
the
sale
of
investments
of
two
joint
ventures
,
he
said
.

Revenue
declined
8
%
to
$
85.7
million
,
from
$
93.3
million

a
year
earlier
.

Savin
cited
``
a
general
softening
in
the
demand
for
office
products
in
the
market
segments
in
which

Savin
competes
.

''


Despite
a
deluge
of
economic
news
,
the
Treasury
market
remained
quiet
but
the
corporate
market
was
abuzz
over
International
Business
Machines
Corp.
's
huge
debt
offering
.

``
There
were
so
many
economic
reports
but
the
market
did
n't
care
about
any
of
them
,
''
said
Kathleen
Camilli
,
a
money
market
economist
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc
.

``
So
the
focus
turned
to
other
fixed-income
markets
,
corporate
and
mortgages
in
particular
,
''
she
said
.

IBM
,
the
giant
computer
maker
,
offered
$
750
million
of
non-callable
30-year
debentures
priced
to
yield
8.47
%
,
or
about
percentage
point
higher
than
the
yield
on
30-year
Treasury
bonds
.

The
size
of
IBM
's
issue
was
increased
from
an
originally
planned
$
500
million
as
money
managers
and
investors
scrambled
to
buy
the
bonds
.

In
the
investment-grade
corporate
market
,
``
it
's
rare
that
you
get
an
opportunity
to
buy
a
name

that
has
such
broad
appeal
and
has
such
attractive
call
features
,
''
said
James
Ednie
,
a
Drexel
industrial
bond
trader
.

Money
managers
ranked
IBM
's
offering
as
the
most
significant
investment-grade
sale
of
the
year
because
large
issues
of
long-term
debt
by
companies
with
triple-A
credit
are
infrequent
.

Syndicate
officials
at
lead
underwriter
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
said
the
debentures
were
snapped
by
up
pension
funds
,
banks
,
insurance
companies
and
other
institutional
investors
.

In
the
Treasury
market
,
investors
paid
scant
attention
to
the
day
's
economic
reports
,
which
for
the
most
part
provided
a
mixed
view
of
the
economy
.

``
Whether
you
thought
the
economy
was
growing
weak
or
holding
steady
,
yesterday
's
economic
indicators
did
n't
change
your
opinion
,
''
said
Charles
Lieberman
,
a
managing
director
at
Manufacturers
Hanover
Securities
Corp
.

The
government
reported
that
orders
for
manufactured
goods
were
essentially
unchanged
in
September
while
construction
spending
was
slightly
lower
.

Both

indicators
were
viewed
as
signs
that
the
nation
's
industrial
sector
is
growing
very
slowly
,
if
at
all
.

A
survey
by
the
Federal
Reserve
's
12
district
banks
and
the
latest
report
by
the
National
Association
of
Purchasing
Management
blurred
that
picture
of
the
economy
.

In
a
monthly
report
prepared
for
use
at
the
Fed
's
next
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
meeting
on
Nov.
14.
,
the
nation
's
central
bank
found
that
price
increases
have
moderated
and
economic
activity
has
grown
at
a
sluggish
pace
in
recent
weeks
.

Among
other
things
,
the
survey
found
that
manufacturing
activity
varied
considerably
across
districts
and
among
industries
.

The
Philadelphia
and
Cleveland
districts
,
for
example
,
reported
declines
in
manufacturing
activity
while
the
Boston
,
Dallas
and
San
Francisco
banks
noted
that
business
expanded
.

The
purchasing
managers
index
of
economic
activity
rose
in
October
,
although
it
remains
below
50
%
.

A
reading
below
50
%
indicates
that
the
manufacturing
sector
is
slowing
while
a
reading
above
50
%
suggests
that
the
industry
is
expanding
.

Mr.
Lieberman
said
the
diverse
showing
in
yesterday
's
reports
``
only
enhances
the
importance
of
the
employment
data
.

''
The
employment
report
,
which
at
times
has
caused
wide
swings
in
bond
prices
,
is
due
out
tomorrow
.

The
average
estimate
of
22
economists
polled
by
Dow
Jones
Capital
Markets
Report
was
that
non-farm
payrolls
expanded
by
152,000
in
October
.

The
economists
forecast
a
0.1
%
rise
in
the
unemployment
rate
to
5.4
%
.

Treasury
Securities

In
a
surprise
announcement
,
the
Treasury
said
it
will
reopen
the
outstanding
benchmark
30-year
bond
rather
than
create
a
new
one
for
next
week
's
quarterly
refunding
of
the
federal
debt
.

The
Treasury
will
raise
$
10
billion
in
fresh
cash
by
selling
$
30
billion
of
securities
,
including
$
10
billion
of
new
three-year
notes
and
$
10
billion
of
new
10-year
notes
.

But
rather
than
sell
new
30-year
bonds
,
the
Treasury
will
issue
$
10
billion
of
29year
,
nine-month
bonds
--
essentially
increasing
the
size
of
the
current
benchmark
30-year
bond

that
was
sold
at
the
previous
refunding
in
August
.

Credit
market
analysts
said
the
decision
to
reopen
the
current
benchmark
,
the
8
%
bond
due
August
2019
,
is
unusual
because
the
issue
trades
at
a
premium
to
its
face
amount
.

Some
dealers
said
the
Treasury
's
intent
is
to
help
government
bond
dealers
gauge
investor
demand
for
the
securities
,
given
uncertainties
about
when
the
auction
will
occur
.

The
Treasury
said
the
refunding
is
contingent
upon
congressional
and
presidential
passage
of
an
increase
in
the
federal
debt
ceiling
.

Until
such
action
takes
places
,
the
Treasury
has
no
ability
to
issue
new
debt
of
any
kind
.

Meanwhile
,
Treasury
bonds
ended
modestly
higher
in
quiet
trading
.

The
benchmark
30-year
bond
about
point
,
or
$
2.50
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
.

The
benchmark
was
priced
at
102
to
yield
7.88
%
compared
with
102
to
yield
7.90
%
Tuesday
.

The
latest
10-year
notes
were
quoted
at
100
to
yield
7.88
%
compared
with
100
to
yield
7.90
%
.

The
discount
rate
on
three-month
Treasury
bills
was
essentially
unchanged
at
7.79
%
,
while
the
rate
on
six-month
bills
was
slightly
lower
at
7.52
%
compared
with
7.60
%
Tuesday
.

Corporate
Issues

IBM
's
$
750
million
debenture
offering
dominated
activity
in
the
corporate
debt
market
.

Meanwhile
,
most
investment-grade
bonds
ended
unchanged
to
as
much
as
point
higher
.

In
its
latest
compilation
of
performance
statistics
,
Moody
's
Investors
Service
found
that
investment-grade
bonds
posted
a
total
return
of
2.7
%
in
October
while
junk
bonds
showed
a
negative
return
of
1.5
%
.

Moody
's
said
those
returns
compare
with
a
3.8
%
total
return
for
longer-term
Treasury
notes
and
bonds
.

Total
return
measures
price
changes
and
interest
income
.

For
the
year
to
date
,
Moody
's
said
total
returns
were
topped
by
the
16.5
%
of
longer-term
Treasury
issues
,
closely
followed
by
15
%
for
investment-grade
bonds
.

Junk
bonds
trailed
the
group
again
.

``
Even
the
7.2
%
return
from
the
risk-free
three-month
Treasury
bill
has
easily
outdistanced
the
4.1
%
return
from
junk
bonds
,
''
wrote
Moody
's
economist
John
Lonski
in
yesterday
's
market
report
.

``
Little
wonder
that
buyers
for
junk
have
been
found
wanting
,
''
he
said
.

Moody

's
said
the
average
net
asset
value
of
24
junk-bond
mutual
funds
fell
by
4.2
%
in
October
.

Mortgage-Backed
Issues

Mortgage
securities
ended
slightly
higher
but
trailed
gains
in
the
Treasury
market
.

Ginnie
Mae
's
9
%
issue
for
November
delivery
finished
at
98
,
up
,
and
its
9
%
issue
at
100
,
also
up
.

The
Ginnie
Mae
9
%
securities
were
yielding
9.32
%
to
a
12-year
average
life
.

Activity
was
light
in
derivative
markets
,
with
no
new
issues
priced
.

Municipal
Issues

Municipal
bonds
were
mostly
unchanged
to
up
point
in
light
,
cautious
trading
prior
to
tomorrow
's
unemployment
report
.

A
$
114
million
issue
of
health
facility
revenue
bonds
from
the
California
Health
Facilities
Financing
Authority
was
temporarily
withdrawn
after
being
tentatively
priced
by
a
First
Boston
Corp.
group
.

An
official
for
the
lead
underwriter
declined
to
comment
on
the
reason
for
the
delay
,
but
market
participants
speculated
that
a
number
of
factors
,
including
a
lack
of
investor
interest
,
were
responsible
.

The
issue
could
be
relaunched
,
possibly
in
a
restructured
form
,
as
early
as
next
week
,
according
to
the
lead
underwriter
.

A
$
107.03
million
offering
of
Santa
Ana
Community
Redevelopment
Agency
,
Calif.
,
tax
allocation
bonds
got
off
to
a
slow
start
and
may
be
repriced
at
lower
levels
today
,
according
to
an
official
with
lead
underwriter
Donaldson
Lufkin
&
Jenrette
Securities
Corp
.

The
Santa
Ana
bonds
were
tentatively
priced
to
yield
from
6.40
%
in
1991
to
7.458
%
in

Bucking
the
market
trend
,
an
issue
of
$
130
million
general
obligation
distributable
state
aid
bonds
from
Detroit
,
Mich.
,
apparently
drew
solid
investor
interest
.

They
were
tentatively
priced
to
yield
from
6.20
%
in
1991
to
7.272
%
in

Foreign
Bond

West
German
dealers
said
there
was
little
interest
in
Treasury
bonds
ahead
of
Thursday
's
new
government
bond
issue
.

So
far
,
they
said
,
investors
appear
unenthusiastic
about
the
new
issue

which
might
force
the
government
to
raise
the
coupon
to
more
than
7
%
.

It
is
generally
expected
to
be
the
usual
10-year
,
four
billion
mark
issue
.

Rumors
to
the
contrary
have
been
that
it
would
be
a
six
billion
mark
issue
,
or
that
the
last
Bund
,
a
7
%
issue
due
October
1999
,
would
be
increased
by
two
billion
marks
.

In

at
95.09
to
yield
5.435
%
.

--
In
Britain
,
the
benchmark
11
%
bond
due
fell
to
111
to

The
12

Consumer
confidence
stayed
strong
in
October
,
despite
the
unsettling
gyrations
of
the
stock
market
.

``
The
sharp
stock
market
decline
in
late
October
appears
to
have
had
little
or
no
effect
on
consumers
,
''
said
Fabian
Linden
,
executive
director
of
the
Conference
Board
's
consumer
research
center
.

``
Survey
returns
received
after
the
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
average
were
about
the
same
as
the
views
expressed
prior
to
that
event
.

''

The
nonprofit
,
industry-supported
group
said
its
Consumer
Confidence
Index
was
116.4
in
October
,
barely
changed
from
a
revised
116.3
in
September
.

The
index
was
116.9
in
October
1988
and
in
the
past
year
has
ranged
from
a
low
of
112.9
to
a
high
of
120.7
.

It
uses
a
base
of
100
in
1985
.

In
October
,
more
people
said
that
present
business
conditions
were
``
good
''
than
in
September
.

An
equal
number
in
each
month
said
that
employment
conditions
were
good
.

And
19.6
%
of
consumers
contacted
believed
business
conditions
will
improve
in
the
coming
six
months
,
compared
with
18.3

.

Also
,
more
people
said
conditions
will
worsen
in
the
period
.

(
Fewer
said

wo
n't
change

)
In
October
1988
,
21.1
%
said
business
conditions
would
improve

In
October
1989
,
16.9

with
28.5
%
in
September
and
26.8
%
in
October
1988
,
said
income
would

``
The

to
the
continued
favorable
circumstances

which
affect
the
consumer
's
day-to-day

life
,
''
said
Mr.
Linden
.

``
Unemployment
continues
at
a
relatively
low

,
providing
a
sense

a
low

rate
has
kept

reasonably
strong

In
1989
,

Rockwell
International
Corp.
reported
flat
operating
earnings
for
the
fourth
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
.

The
aerospace
,
automotive
supply
,
electronics
and
printing-press
concern
also
indicated
that
the
first

half
of
fiscal
1990
could
be
rough
.

In
an
interview
,
Donald
Beall
,
chairman
,
said
first-half
profit
certainly
would
trail
the
past
year
's
,
primarily
because
of
weakness
in
the
heavy-truck
and
passenger-car
markets
.

Still
,
he
added
,
if
the
industrial
sector
remains
relatively
stable
,
Rockwell
should
be
able
to
recover
in
the
second

half
and
about
equal
fiscal
1989
's
operating
profit
of
$
630.9
million
.

For
fiscal
1989
's
fourth
quarter
,
Rockwell
's
net
income
totaled
$
126.1
million
,
or
50
cents

a
share
.

That
compares
with
operating
earnings
of
$
132.9
million
,
or
49
cents

a
share
,
the
year
earlier
.

The
prior-year
period
includes
a
one-time
favorable
tax
adjustment
on
the
B-1B
bomber
program
and
another
gain
from
sale
of
the
industrial
sewing-machine
business
,
which
made
net
$
185.9
million
,
or
70
cents

a
share
.

Sales
rose
4
%
to
$
3.28
billion
from
$
3.16
billion
.

Mr.
Beall
said
that
he
was
generally
pleased
with
the
latest
numbers
and
cited
a
particularly
strong
showing
by
the
company
's
electronics
segment
.

Overall
,
pretax
electronics
earnings
soared
12
%
to
$
107.9
million
from
$
96.4
million
.

All
four
areas
had
higher
revenue
for
the
three
months
ended
Sept.
30
.

For
the
year
,
electronics
emerged
as
Rockwell
's
largest
sector
in
terms
of
sales
and
earnings
,
muscling
out
aerospace
for
the
first
time
.

The
graphics
business
,
which
also
was
singled
out
by
the
chairman
as
a
positive
,
saw
its
operating
earnings
for
the
quarter
jump
79
%
to
$
42.1
million
from
$
23.5
million
.

For
the
year
,
bolstered
by
the
introduction
of
the
Colorliner
newspaper-printing
press
,
graphics
earnings
almost
doubled
.

Aerospace
earnings
sagged
37
%
for
the
quarter
and
15
%
for
the
year
,
largely
due
to
lower
B-1B
program
profit
;
the
last
of
the
bombers
rolled
out
in
April
1988
.

That
was
partially
offset
by
the
resumption
of
space
shuttle
flights
and
increased
demand
for
expendable
launch-vehicle
engines
.

The
company
also
took
hits
in
the
fourth
quarters
of
1989
and
1988
on
a
fixed-price
weapons-modernization
development
program
--
probably
the
C-130
gunship
,
according
to
analysts
.

For
fiscal
1989
,
the
company
posted
net
of
$
734.9
million
,
or
$
2.87

a
share
,
down
from
$
811.9
million
,
or
$
3.04

a
share
,
in
fiscal
1988
.

Excluding
one-time
additions
to
profit
in
each
year
,
earnings
per
share
were
$
2.47
,
up
7.4
%
from
$
2.30
in
fiscal
1988
.

Sales
for
the
year
rose
5
%
to
$
12.52
billion
from
$
11.95
billion
in
fiscal
1988
.

Meridian
National
Corp.
said
it
sold
750,000
shares
of
its
common
stock
to
the
McAlpine
family
interests
,
for
$
1
million
,
or
$
1.35

a
share
.

The
sale
represents
10.2
%
of
Meridian
's
shares
outstanding
.

The
McAlpine
family
,
which
operates
a
number
of
multinational
companies
,
including
a
London-based
engineering
and
construction
company
,
also
lent
to
Meridian
National
$
500,000
.

That
amount
is
convertible
into
shares
of
Meridian
common
stock
at
$
2

a
share
during
its
one-year
term
.

The
loan
may
be
extended
by
the
McAlpine
group
for
an
additional
year
with
an
increase
in
the
conversion
price
to
$
2.50

a
share
.

The
sale
of
shares
to
the
McAlpine
family
along
with
the
recent
sale
of
750,000
shares
of
Meridian
stock
to
Haden
MacLellan
Holding
PLC
of
Surrey
,
England
and
a
recent
public
offering
have
increased
Meridian
's
net
worth
to
$
8.5
million
,
said
William
Feniger
,
chief
executive
officer
of
Toledo
,
Ohio-based
Meridian
.

Upjohn
Co.
said
it
will
offer
an
early
retirement
package
to
as
many
as
1,100
employees
in
a
cost-cutting
move
expected
to
result
in
a
fourth-quarter
charge
.

Upjohn
officials
said
they
could
n't
estimate
the
size
of
the
charge
until
they
determine
which
employees
,
and
how
many
,
will
participate
in
the
retirement
plan
.

But
the
pharmaceutical
company
said
it
``
anticipates
the
long-term
savings
resulting
from
the
plan
's
implementation
will
more
than
offset
short-term
costs
.

''

The
program
,
available
to
Upjohn
employees
55
years
old
or
older
,
could
increase
an
individual
's
retirement
benefits
10
%
to
20
%
.

In
addition
,
Upjohn
is
offering
a
one-time
retirement
bonus
equal
to
six
months
of
base
pay
.

Chairman
Theodore
Cooper
called
the
program
part
of
the
company
's
two-year
strategy
to
implement
budget
constraints
and
``
an
effective
headcount-control
program
.

''

But
some
analysts
questioned
how
much
of
an
impact

the
retirement
package
will
have
,
because
few
jobs
will
end
up
being
eliminated
.

``
It
's
a
cosmetic
move
,
''
said
Jonathan
S.
Gelles
of
Wertheim
Schroder
&
Co
.

According
to
Upjohn
's
estimates
,
only
50
%
to
60
%
of
the
1,100
eligible
employees
will
take
advantage
of
the
plan
.

Upjohn
further
estimated
that
about
50
%
of
the
employees

who
leave
for
early
retirement
may
be
replaced
.

As
a
result
,
Upjohn
will
likely
trim
only
about
275
to
350
of
its
more
than
21,000
jobs
world-wide
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
yesterday
,
Upjohn
shares
rose
87.5
cents
to
$
38.875
apiece
.

An
Upjohn
spokesman
said
he
had
``
heard
nothing
''
to
suggest
the
early
retirement
package
was
spurred
by
shareholder
pressure
or
a
potential
bidder
for
the
company
,
which
occasionally
has
been
the
target
of
takeover
speculation
.

The
company
earlier
this
year
adopted
a
shareholder-rights
plan
to
ward
off
unwanted
suitors
.

The
spokesman
said
it
is
the
first
early
retirement
plan
offered
under
its
two-year
cost-control
strategy
.

Earlier
staff-reduction
moves
have
trimmed
about
300
jobs
,
the
spokesman
said
.

A.L.
Williams
Corp.
was

Primerica
Corp.
,
New

,
after
a
special

the

Primerica

about
16.7

,
currently
valued

$
472

,
for
the

The

A
man
from
the
Bush
administration
came
before
the
House
Agriculture
Committee
yesterday
to
talk
about
the
U.S.
's
intention
to
send
some
$
100
million
in
food
aid
to
Poland
,
with
more
to
come
from
the
EC
.

The
committee
's
members
are
worried
what
all
this
free
food
might
do
to
the
economic
prospects
of
Poland
's
own
farmers
.

Rep.
Gary
Ackerman
noted
that
past
food
aid
had
harmed
farmers
in
El
Salvador
and
Egypt
.

However
well
intentioned
,
food
transfers
have
the
habit
of
growing
larger
and
wrecking
the
market
incentives
for
the
recipient
country
's
own
farmers
.

The
First
World
has
for
some
time
had
the
bad
habit
of
smothering
other
people
's
economies
with
this
kind
of
unfocused
kindness
.

It
should
be
constantly
stressed
that
Poland
's
farmers
mostly
need
a
real
market
for
their
products
.

Congress
has
been
critical
of
the
Bush
administration
for
not
sending
enough
aid
to
Poland
,
so
it
is
getting
ready
to
send
its
own
version
of
a
CARE
package
.

Last
month
,
the
Senate
voted
to
send
a
delegation
of
congressional
staffers
to
Poland
to
assist
its
legislature
,
the
Sejm
,
in
democratic
procedures
.

Senator
Pete
Domenici
calls
this
effort
``
the
first
gift
of
democracy
.

''
The
Poles
might
do
better
to
view
it
as
a
Trojan
Horse
.

It
is
the
vast
shadow
government
of
15,000
congressional
staffers
that
helps
create
such
legislative
atrocities
as
the
1,376
page
,
13-pound
reconciliation
bill

that
claimed
to
be
the
budget
of
the
United
States
.

Maybe
after
the
staffers
explain
their
work
to
the
Poles
,
they
'd
be
willing
to
come
back
and
do
the
same
for
the
American
people
.

Steve

reported
for

a.m.

two
and
a
half
hours
before
the
usual
Monday
morning

meeting

At
Jefferies

,
J.
Francis
Palamara
did
n't
reach
the
office
until
5:30
a.m.
,

then
he
had
been
up
most
of
the
night
at

``
I
had

For
many
of
London
's
securities
traders
,
it
was
a
day

that
started
nervously
in
the
small
hours
.

By
lunchtime
,
the
selling
was
at
near-panic
fever
.

But
as
the
day
ended
in
a
frantic
Wall
Street-inspired
rally
,
the
City
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
.

So
it
went
yesterday
in
the
trading
rooms
of
London
's
financial
district
.

In
the
wake
of
Wall
Street
's
plunge
last
Friday
,
the
London
market
was
considered
especially
vulnerable
.

And
before
the
opening
of
trading
here
yesterday
,
all
eyes
were
on
early
trading
in
Tokyo
for
a
clue
as
to
how
widespread
the
fallout
might
be
.

By
the
time
trading
officially
got
under
way
at
9
a.m.
,
the
news
from
Asia
was
in
.

And
it
left
mixed
signals
for
London
.

Tokyo
stocks
closed
off
a
significant
but
less-than-alarming
1.8
%
on
thin
volume
;
Hong
Kong
stocks
declined
6.5
%
in
orderly
trading
.

At
Jefferies
'
trading
room
on
Finsbury
Circus
,
a
stately
circle
at
the
edge
of
the
financial
district
,
desktop
computer
screens
displayed
the
London
market
's
major
barometer
--
the
Financial
Times-Stock
Exchange
100
Share
Index
.

Red
figures
on
the
screens
indicated
falling
stocks
;
blue
figures
,
rising
stocks
.

Right
away
,
the
reds
outnumbered
the
blues
,
80
to
20
,
as
the
index
opened
at
2076.8
,
off
157.1
points
,
or
7
%
.

``
I
see
concern
,
but
I
do
n't
see
any
panic
,
''
said
Mr.
Palamara
,
a
big
,
good-humored
New
York
native

who
runs
the
15-trader
office
.

The
Jefferies
office
,
a
branch
of
the
Los
Angeles-based
firm
,
played
it
conservatively
,
seeking
to
avoid
risk
.

``
This
is
not
the
sort
of
market
to
have
a
big
position
in
,
''
said
David
Smith
,
who
heads
trading
in
all
non-U.S.
stocks
.

``
We
tend
to
run
a
very
tight
book
.

''
Jefferies
spent
most
of
its
energies
in
the
morning
trying
to
match
buyers
and
sellers
,
and
there
were
n't
many
buyers
.

``
All
the
takeover
stocks
--
Scottish
&
Newcastle
,
B.A.T
,
DRG
--
are
getting
pretty
well
pasted
this
morning
,
''
Mr.
Smith
said
.

Seconds
later
,
a
7,500-share
``
sell
''
order
for
Scottish
&
Newcastle
came
in
.

For
the
third
time
in
15
minutes
,
a
trader
next
to
Mr.
Smith
left
the
no-smoking
area
to
have
a
cigarette
.

On
the
screens
,
only
two
forlorn
blue
figures
remained
,
but
the
index
had
recovered
a
few
points
and
was
off
about
140
.

``
Because
Tokyo
did
n't
collapse
,
let
's
pick
up
a
little
stock
,
''
Mr.
Smith
said
.

He
targeted
7,500
shares
of
Reuters
and
punched
a
button
to
call
up
on
his
screen
other
dealers
'
price
quotes
.

The
vivid
yellow
figures
showed
the
best
price
at
845
pence
,
(
$
13.27
)
and
Mr.
Smith
's
traders
started
putting
out
feelers
.

But
the
market
sensed
a
serious
buyer
on
a
day
dominated
by
selling
,
and
the
quotes
immediately
jumped
to
850
pence
.

``
When
I
want
to
buy
,
they
run
from
you
--
they
keep
changing
their
prices
,
''
Mr.
Smith
said
.

``
It
's
very
frustrating
.

''
He
temporarily
abandoned
his
search
for
the
Reuters
shares
.

By
this
time
,
it
was
4:30
a.m.
in
New
York
,
and
Mr.
Smith
fielded
a
call
from
a
New
York
customer
wanting
an
opinion
on
the
British
stock
market
,
which
had
been
having
troubles
of
its
own
even
before
Friday
's
New
York
market
break
.

``
Fundamentally
dangerous
...
,
''
Mr.
Smith
said
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
``
...
.

fundamentally
weak
...
fairly
vulnerable
still
...
extremely
dangerously
poised
...
we
're
in
for
a
lot
of
turbulence
...
.

''

He
was
right
.

By
midday
,
the
London
market
was
in
full
retreat
.

``
It
's
falling
like
a
stone
,
''
said
Danny
Linger
,
a
pit
trader

who
was
standing
outside
the
London
International
Financial
Futures
Exchange
.

Only
half
the
usual
lunchtime
crowd
gathered
at
the
tony
Corney
&
Barrow
wine
bar
on
Old
Broad
Street
nearby
.

Conversation
was
subdued
as
most
patrons
watched
the
latest
market
statistics
on
television
.

At
12:49
p.m.
,
the
index
hit
its
low
,
2029.7
,
off
204.2
points
.

``
France
opened
the
limit
down

off
at

10
%

you
could
calculate
the
index
,
which

you
could
n't

''
Mr.
Clark
,
the
Shearson
trader
,
said
early
in
the
afternoon
.

``
Spain

badly
damaged

''

As
2:30
p.m.
--
Wall
Street
's
opening
time
--
neared
,
Shearson
traders
and
salesmen
traded
bets
on
how
low
the
New
York
market
would
open
.

In
the
center
of
the
trading
floor
,
chief
trader
Roger
Streeter
and
two
colleagues
scrambled
for
the
telephones
as
soon
as
the
New
York
market
opened
--
plummeting
more
than
60
points
in
the
first
few
minutes
.

They
saw
an
opportunity
created
by
the
sell-off
.

As
Wall
Street
traders
dumped
American
Depositary
Receipts
in
Jaguar
PLC
,
Mr.
Streeter
and
trader
Sam
Ruiz
bought
them
to
resell
in
the
U.K
.


Investors
here
still
expect
Ford
Motor
Co.
or
General
Motors
Corp.
to
bid
for
Jaguar
.

Suddenly
,
after
about
45
minutes
,
the
U.S.
markets
rallied
.

``
The
MMI
has
gone
better
,
''
shouted
one
trader
at
about
3:15
London
time
,
as
the
U.S.
Major
Markets
Index
contract
suddenly
indicated
a
turnabout
.

As
Wall
Street
strengthened
,
the
London
trading
room
went
wild
.

Traders
shouted
as
their
screens
posted
an
ever-narrowing
loss
on
Wall
Street
.

Then
,
nine
minutes
later
,
Wall
Street
suddenly
rebounded
to
a
gain
on
the
day
.

``
Rally
!

Rally
!

Rally
!

''
shouted
Shearson
trader
Andy
Rosen
,
selling
more
Jaguar
shares
.

``
This
is
panic
buying
!

''

As
the
London
market
rallied
,
some
wondered
whether
the
weekend
of
worrying
and
jitters
had
been
worth
it
.

The
London
index
closed
at
2163.4
,
its
high
for
the
day
,
off
70.5
,
or
about
3.3

John
W.
Day
,
president
of
Allied-Signal
Automotive
and
executive
vice
president
of

has
been
named
to
the
board
of
this

Nintendo
Co.
,
a
Japanese
maker

posted
a
23
%
unconsolidated

to
61.41

from
50

(
$

rose
11

from

.

Pershare
net
fell
to
423.3
yen
from
457.7
yen
because
of
expenses
and
capital
adjustments
.

Without
detailing
specific
product
breakdowns
,
Nintendo
credited
its
bullish
upsurge
in
sales
--
including
advanced
computer
games
and
television
entertainment
systems
--
to
surging
``
leisure-oriented
''
sales
in
foreign
markets

,
totaled
184.74

months
,
up
from
106.06

the
previous
fiscal

Domestic

,
however
,
were
lower

Skipper
's
Inc.
,
Bellevue
,
Wash.
,
said
it
signed
a
definitive
merger
agreement
for
a
National
Pizza
Corp.
unit
to
acquire
the
90.6
%
of
Skipper
's
Inc.
it
does
n't
own
for
$
11.50

a
share
,
or
about
$
28.1
million
.

NP
Acquisition
Co.
,
a
National
Pizza
unit
,
plans
to
begin
a
tender
offer
for
Skipper
's
on
Friday
,
conditioned
on
at
least
two-thirds
of
Skipper
's
shares
being
tendered
.

Pittsburg
,
Kan.-based
National
Pizza
said
the
transaction
will
be
financed
under
its
revolving
credit
agreement
.

In
national
over-the-counter
trading
,
Skipper
's
shares
rose
50
cents
to
$
11
.

Skipper
's
said
the
merger
will
help
finance
remodeling
and
future
growth
.

Skipper
's
previously
turned
down
a
$
10-a-share
proposal
from
National
Pizza
and
Pizza
Hut
Inc.
questioned
whether
the
purchase
would
violate
National
Pizza
's
franchise
agreements
.

National
Pizza
said
it
settled
its
dispute
with
Pizza
Hut
,
allowing
it
to
make
the
purchase
.

Also
,
Skipper
's
results
began
to
turn
around
,
permitting
a
higher
offer
,
National
Pizza
said
.

For
the
12
weeks
ended
Sept.
3
,
Skipper
's
had
net
income
of
$
361,000
,
or
13
cents

a
share
,
compared
with
a
net
loss

a
year
earlier
.

Revenue
was
$
19.9
million
.

Bear
Stearns
's
chief
economist
,
Lawrence
Kudlow
,
in
the
Sept.
29
issue
of
the
firm
's
Global
Spectator
:

Were

it
true
that
a
weak
currency
paves
the
way
for
trade
surpluses
,
then
presumably
Argentina
would
be
the
center
of
today
's
global
economy
.

A
House-Senate
conference
approved
a
permanent
smoking
ban
on
all
domestic
airline
routes
within
the
continental
U.S.
and
on
all
flights
of
six
hours
or
less
to
Alaska
and
Hawaii
.

The
restrictions
would
cover
all
but
a
small
percentage
of
domestic
air
traffic
,
and
represent
a
major
expansion
of
the
current
smoking
ban
on
flights
of
two
hours
or
less
.

The
exemption
allowed
on
longer
flights
to
Alaska
and
Hawaii
appears
to
be
largely
a
face-saving
concession
for
the
traditionally
powerful
tobacco
industry
,
which
has
found
itself
increasingly
isolated
in
the
face
of
public
pressure
in
recent
years
.

By
a
6-4
margin
,
House
negotiators
initially
rejected
last
night

a
Senate
provision
covering
all
domestic
flights
.

But
the
six-hour
compromise
was
soon
agreed
to
in
subsequent
discussions
.

As
a
practical
matter
,
flights
from
the
West
Coast
to
Hawaii
would
be
covered
as
they
are
under
the
time
limit
,
but
the
language
would
exempt
longer
routes
beginning
,
for
example
,
in
Chicago
or
on
the
East
Coast
.

Within
the
Senate
,
the
ban
has
had
aggressive
support
from
Sen.
Frank
Lautenberg
(
D.
,
N.J.
)
,
who
has
used
his
position
as
a
Senate
Appropriations
subcommittee
chairman
to
garner
votes
for
the
initiative
.

The
measure
is
attached
to
the
more
than
$
26
billion
fiscal
1990
transportation
bill
within
Mr.
Lautenberg
's
jurisdiction
,
and
the
final
compromise
is
laced
with
more
than
$
205
million
in
road
projects
earmarked
by
members
as
well
as
funds
sought
by
major
airports
,
including
Denver
.

From
the
outset
,
the
tobacco
industry
has
been
uncertain
as
to
what
strategy
to
follow
.

But
the
industry
retains
support
in
the
House
leadership
through
the
influence
of
grower
states
,
such
as
North
Carolina
.

Majority
Whip
William
Gray
owes
a
political
debt
to
Southern
agriculture
lawmakers
for
his
rise
in
the
House
,
and
the
Philadelphia
Democrat
used
his
position
in
the
conference
to
salvage
the
exemption
from
a
total
ban
.

Although
the
smoking
provision
has
attracted
the
most
public
interest
,
the
underlying
bill
was
the
subject
of
behind-the-scenes
lobbying
because
of
its
impact
on
air
transportation
and
the
more
mundane
,
but
politically
important
,
projects
of
members
.

In
a
stark
lesson
in
the
power
of
the
appropriations
committees
,
the
House
deliberately
killed
a
handful
of
projects
backed
by
lawmakers
in
Florida
,
Illinois
and
Pennsylvania

who
had
voted
against
the
panel
leadership
on
the
House
floor
.

``
Anybody
can
vote
as
they
want
,
''
said
Rep.
William
Lehman
(
D.
,
Fla.
)
,
head
of
the
House
conferees
.

``
But
if
you
make
a
request
,
you
should
support
the
committee
.

''

Within
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
,
the
final
bill
promises
to
increase
spending
for
facilities
and
equipment
by
more
than
20
%
from
last
year
,
and
total
operations
would
rise
to
$
3.84
billion
--
a
12
%
boost
.

The
facilities
account
includes
$
40
million
for
Denver
's
ambitious
new
airport
,
and
the
competition
for
these
funds
created
shifting
alliances
between
urban
lawmakers
representing
established
airports
in
Philadelphia
and
Michigan
and
the
major
carriers
to
Denver
,
United
and
Continental
.

Leery
of
the
costs
--
and
,
critics
say
,
competition
--
the
airlines
have
sought
to
gain
leverage
over
the
city
of
Denver
.

Texas
Air
Corp.
,
which
owns
Continental
,
and
the
Air
Transport
Association
were
prominent
in
the
lobbying
.

The
industry
sought
to
impose
conditions

that
would
have
delayed
funds
for
the
project
until
Denver
and
the
airlines
had
agreed
to
leases
for
50
%
of
the
gates
.

But
this
was
rejected
in
favor
of
much
looser
language
directing
the
Transportation
Department
to
review
the
costs
of
the
first
phase
,
expected
to
cost
about
$
2
billion
.

Though
smaller
in
total
dollars
,
the
conference
agreed
to
preserve
an
estimated
$
30.6
million
in
controversial
subsidies
to
carriers
serving
rural
or
isolated
airports
.

The
sum
is
more
than
double

what

the
House
had
approved
for
the
program
,
but
the
list
of
qualified
airports
would
be
cut
by
22
under
new
distance
requirements
and
limits
on
the
level
of
subsidy
.

Congress
previously
cut
six
airports

this
year
.

The
impact
of
the
changes
is
to
eliminate
many
of
the
most
excessive
cases
where
the
government
has
been
paying
more
than
$
200
for
each
passenger
in
subsidies
.

Among
rail
and
highway
accounts
,
the
agreement
provides
$
615
million
for
Amtrak
,
including
$
85
million
for
capital
improvements
.

And
federal-formula
grants
for
mass
transit
would
be
effectively
frozen
at
$
1.625
billion
,
or
$
20
million
more
than
last
fiscal
year
.

We
're
about
to
see
if
advertising
works
.

Hard
on
the
heels
of
Friday
's
190-point
stock-market
plunge
and
the
uncertainty

that
's
followed
,
a
few
big
brokerage
firms
are
rolling
out
new
ads
trumpeting
a
familiar
message
:
Keep
on
investing
,
the
market
's
just
fine
.

Their
mission
is
to
keep
clients
from
fleeing
the
market
,
as
individual
investors
did
in
droves
after
the
crash
in
October

Just
days
after
the
1987
crash
,
major
brokerage
firms
rushed
out
ads
to
calm
investors
.

This
time
around
,
they
're
moving
even
faster
.

PaineWebber
Inc.
filmed
a
new
television
commercial
at
4
p.m.
EDT
yesterday
and
had
it
on
the
air
by
last
night
.

Fidelity
Investments
placed
new
ads
in
newspapers
yesterday
,
and
wrote
another
new
ad
appearing
today
.

Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
by
yesterday
afternoon
had
already
written
new
TV
ads
.

It
considered
running
them
during
tomorrow
night
's
World
Series
broadcast
but
decided
not
to
when
the
market
recovered
yesterday
.

Other
brokerage
firms
,
including
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
,
were
plotting
out
potential
new
ad
strategies
.

The
brokerage
firms
learned
a
lesson

the
last
time
around
,
when
frightened
investors
flooded
the
phone
lines
and
fled
the
market
in
a
panic
.

This
time
,
the
firms
were
ready
.

Fidelity
,
for
example
,
prepared
ads
several
months
ago
in
case
of
a
market
plunge
.

When
the
market
went
into
its
free
fall
Friday
afternoon
,
the
investment
firm
ordered
full
pages
in
the
Monday
editions
of
half
a
dozen
newspapers
.

The
ads
touted
Fidelity
's
automated
800-number
beneath
the
huge
headline
,
``
Fidelity
Is
Ready
For
Your
Call
.

''

A
Fidelity
spokesman
says
the
800-line
,
which
already
was
operating
but
which

many
clients
did
n't
know
about
,
received
about
double
the
usual
volume
of
calls
over
the
weekend
.

``
A
lot
of
investor
confidence
comes
from
the
fact
that
they
can
speak
to
us
,
''
he
says
.

``
To
maintain
that
dialogue
is
absolutely
crucial
.

It
would
have
been
too
late
to
think
about
on
Friday
.

We
had
to
think
about
it
ahead
of
time
.

''

Today
's
Fidelity
ad
goes
a
step
further
,
encouraging
investors
to
stay
in
the
market
or
even
to
plunge
in
with
Fidelity
.

Underneath
the
headline
``
Diversification
,
''
it
counsels
,
``
Based
on
the
events
of
the
past
week
,
all
investors
need
to
know
their
portfolios
are
balanced
to
help
protect
them
against
the
market
's
volatility
.

''
It
goes
on
to
plug
a
few
diversified
Fidelity
funds
by
name
.

PaineWebber
also
was
able
to
gear
up
quickly
thanks
to
the
1987
crash
.

In
the
aftermath
of
the
1987
debacle
,
the
brokerage
firm
began
taping
commercials
in-house
,
ultimately
getting
its
timing
down
fast
enough
to
tape
a
commercial
after
the
market
closed
and
rush
it
on
the
air

that
night
.

It
also
negotiated
an
arrangement
with
Cable
News
Network
under
which

CNN
would
agree
to
air
its
last-minute
creations
.

The
new
PaineWebber
commercial
,
created
with
ad
agency
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
Co.
,
features
Mary
Farrell
,
one
of
the
firm
's
most
visible
investment
strategists
,
sounding
particularly
bullish
.

Taped
just
as
the
market
closed
yesterday
,
it
offers
Ms.
Farrell
advising
,
``
We
view
the
market
here
as
going
through
a
relatively
normal
cycle
...
.

We
continue
to
feel
that
the
stock
market
is
still
the
place
to
be
for
long-term
appreciation
.

''
The
spot
was
scheduled
to
appear
three
times
on
CNN
last
night
.

PaineWebber
considered
an
even
harder
sell
,
recommending
specific
stocks
.

Instead
,
it
settled
on
just
urging
the
clients

who
are
its
lifeline
to
keep
that
money
in
the
market
.

``
We
're
saying
the
worst
thing
that
anyone
can
do
is
to
see
the
market
go
down
and
dump
everything
,
which
just
drives
the
prices
down
further
,
''
says
John
Lampe
,
PaineWebber
's
director
of
advertising
.

``
If
you
owned
it
and
liked
it

Friday
,
the
true
value
has
n't
changed
.

''
He
adds
,
``
This
is
n't
1987
revisited
.

''

With
the
market
fluctuating
and
then
closing
up
more
than
88
points
yesterday
,
investment
firms
had
to
constantly
revise
their
approach
.

At
Shearson
Lehman
,
executives
created
potential
new
commercials
Friday
night
and
throughout
the
weekend
,
then
had
to
regroup
yesterday
afternoon
.

The
plan
had
been
to
make
one
of
Shearson
's
easy-to-film
,
black-and-white
``
Where
We
Stand
''
commercials
,
which
have
been
running
occasionally
in
response
to
news
events
since
1985
.

The
ad
would
have
run
during
the
World
Series
tomorrow
,
replacing
the
debut
commercial
of
Shearson
's
new
ad
campaign
,
``
Leadership
by
Example
.

''

But
in
a
meeting
after
the
market
closed
yesterday
,
Shearson
executives
decided
not
to
go
ahead
with
the
stock-market
ad
.

``
We
do
n't
think
at
this
point

anything
needs
to
be
said
.

The
market
seems
to
be
straightening
out
;
we
're
taking
a
wait-and-see
attitude
,
''
says
Cathleen
B.
Stewart
,
executive
vice
president
of
marketing
.

In
any
case
,
the
brokerage
firms
are
clearly
moving
faster
to
create
new
ads
than
they
did
in
the
fall
of
1987
.

But
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
their
ads
will
be
any
more
effective
.

In
1987
,
despite
a
barrage
of
ads
from
most
of
the
major
investment
firms
,
individuals
ran
from
the
market
en
masse
.

Now
the
firms
must
try
their
hardest
to
prove
that
advertising
can
work
this
time
around
.

Notes

ARNOLD
ADVERTISING
:
Edward
Eskandarian
,
former
chairman
of
Della
Femina
,
McNamee
,
reached
an
agreement
in
principle
to
acquire
a
majority
stake
in
Arnold

Commodity
futures
prices
generally
reflected
the
stability
of
the
stock
market
following
its
plunge
Friday
.

Yesterday
,
the
stock
market
's
influence
at
first
created
nervousness
.

Later
,
however
,
it
became
more
of
an
undercurrent
than
a
dominating
force
as
individual
markets
reacted
more
to
their
own
factors
.

Gold
,
the
traditional
haven
in
times
of
financial
crisis
,
continued
its
inverse
lockstep
with
the
dollar
,
rising
early
in
the
day
as
the
currency
fell
,
and
then
giving
up
some
of
its
gains
as
the
dollar
recovered
.

Copper
and
crude
oil
reacted
sharply
to
the
concern
that
a
crash
yesterday
could
have
a
potentially
devastating
effect
on
the
economy
.

Copper
fell
and
showed
little
rebound
through
the
day
as
one
of
the
major
supply
problems

that
had
been
supporting
prices
appeared
to
be
solved
.

Crude
oil
declined
early
,
but
as
the
stock
market
retained
early
gains
,
it
,
too
,
became
stronger
,
ending
with
a
small
net
loss
.

Trading
in
cotton
and
sugar
was
nervous
and
showed
small
declines
.

In
Chicago
,
grain
and
soybean
prices
rose
slightly
.

Livestock
and
meat
prices
,
however
,
dropped
on
concern
that
a
financial
crisis
would
cut
consumption
of
beef
and
pork
.

In
commodity
markets
yesterday
:

PRECIOUS
METALS
:
Futures
prices
were
moderately
higher
as
gold
gave
up
some
of
its
early
gains
and
platinum
behaved
independently
,
first
falling
and
then
later
rising
.

Silver
performed
quietly
.

The
spot
October
gold
price
rose
$
4
to
$
367.30

an
ounce
.

The
more
active
December
delivery
gold
settled
with
a
gain
of
$
3.90

an
ounce
at
$
371.20
,
after
trading
as
high
as
$
374
.

December
silver
was
up
2.3
cents

an
ounce
at
$
5.163
.

Platinum
behaved
more
like
an
industrial
metal
,
easing
early
on
concern
over
a
possible
weaker
economy
,
but
recovering
later
,
as
the
stock
market
strengthened
.

Gold
was
nowhere
the
spectacular
performer

it
was
two
years
ago
on
Black
Monday
.

For
one
thing
,
last
Friday
,
precious
metals
markets
closed
before
the
stock
market
went
into
its
late-in-the-day
nose
dive
,
so
it
could
n't
react
to
it
.

Back
on
Friday
,
Oct.
16
,
l987
,
the
stock
market
declined
during
the
day
,
and
gold
prices
surged
as
the
stock
market
fell
.

The
October
1987
contract

that
day
rose
as
much
as
$
8.70
to
as
high
as
$
471.60
,
and
the
more
deferred
positions
,
due
to
mature
as
late
as
March
1989
,
rose
as
much
as
$
9.60
.

On
Black
Monday
,
Oct.
19
,
1987
,
the
October
contract
tacked
on
further
gains
,
rising
to
as
high
as
$
491.50
for
a
gain
of
almost
$
20
on
top
of
the
Friday
advances
,
before
giving
up
almost
$
10
of
that
at
the
close
.

Yesterday
's
October
gain
of
$
4
was
miniscule
compared
with
that
.

One
analyst
,
Peter
Cardillo
of
Josephthal
&
Co.
,
New
York
,
said
the
gold
market
already
had
some
good
price-supporting
technical
factors

that
would
have
caused
prices
to
rise
,
with
or
without
the
stock
market
.

``
What

the
stock
market
did
was
cause
the
rise
to
take
place
earlier
than
it
would
have
happened
,
''
said
Mr.
Cardillo
.

There
's
a
good
chance

that
gold
will
retain
its
gains
and
rise
further
,
he
said
.

He
expects
a
drop
in
interest
rates
,
which
would
help
gold
by
keeping
the
dollar
from
rising
.

Finally
,
according
to
Mr.
Cardillo
,
the
impact
of
the
strong
dollar
should
be
reflected
in
reduced
exports
in
the
August
merchandise
trade
deficit
,
when
the
figures
are
released
today
.

This
would
be
damaging
to
the
dollar
and
supportive
for
gold
,
he
said
.

ENERGY
:
Worried
that
Friday
's
190-point
stock
market
plunge
might
be
a
harbinger
of
things
to
come
for
the
economy
,
petroleum
futures
traders
called
a
halt
to
the
recent
string
of
increases
in
crude
oil
futures
prices
.

The
U.S.
benchmark
crude
,
West
Texas
Intermediate
,
closed
at
$
20.59

a
barrel
for
November
delivery
,
down
30
cents
.

Some
analysts
said
crude
was
due
for
a
correction
anyhow
,
following
several
days
of
significant
gains
.

But
most
market
observers
agreed
that
Friday
's
stock
market
drop
is
what
dampened
spirits
in
the
petroleum
pits
yesterday
.

Until
yesterday
,
futures
prices
had
been
headed
up
on
expectations
that
world
oil
demand
will
continue
to
be
strong
.

The
Organization
of
Petroleum
Exporting
Countries
increased
its
production
ceiling
for
the
fourth
quarter
based
on
projections
of
robust
demand
.

So
any
bearish
indicator
,
such
as
Friday
's
precipitous
drop
in
the
stock
market
,
sends
shivers
through
the
oil
markets
as
well
.

Indeed
,
after
reacting
early
in
the
trading
day
to
Friday
's
plummet
,
futures
prices
firmed
up
again
as
traders
took
note
of
the
stock
market
's
partial
recovery
yesterday
.

COPPER
:
Futures
prices
fell
and
showed
little
rebound
as
one

major
labor
problem

that
had
been
underpinning
prices
appeared
to
be
solved
.

The
December
contract
declined
3.05
cents

a
pound
to
$
1.2745
.

Prices
were
down
from
the
outset
of
trading
on
concern
that
a
drop
in
the
stock
market
might
create
a
weakened
economy
and
a
consequent
reduction
in
copper
use
.

But
the
recovery
in
the
stock
market
provided
little
help
for
copper
as
word
spread
that
a
three-month
strike
at
the
Highland
Valley
mine
in
British
Columbia
was
about
over
,
according
to
an
analyst
.

Highland
Valley
is
a
large
Canadian
producer
and
principal
supplier
to
Japan
,
which
recently
began
seeking
copper
elsewhere
as
its
inventories
shrank
.

Last
week

it
was
reported
that
company
and
union
negotiations
had
overcome
the
major
hurdle
,
the
contracting
out
of
work
by
the
company
.

Now
,
the
analyst
said
,
only
minor
points
remain
to
be
cleaned
up
.

``
For
all
intents
and
purposes
,
an
agreement
appears
to
have
been
achieved
,
''
he
said
.

Copper
inventories
in
New
York
's
Commodity
Exchange
warehouses
rose
yesterday
by
516
tons
,
to
10,004
tons
.

London
Metal
Exchange
copper
inventories
last
week
declined
13,575
tons
,
to
89,300
tons
.

The
LME
stocks
decline
was
about
as
expected
,
but
the
Comex
gain
was
n't
.

However
,
this
was
brushed
aside
by
concern
over
the
stock
market
,
the
analyst
said
.

At
one
point
in
futures
trading
,
as
the
stock
market
firmed
,
the
December
contract
rose
to
as
high
as
$
1.2965
,
but
it

was
n't
able
to
sustain
the
gain
.

``
It
was
simply
overbought
,
''
he
said
,
and
selling
by
funds

that
are
computer
guided
helped
depress
prices
.

COTTON
:
Futures
prices
eased
,
more
in
reaction
to
Hurricane
Jerry
than
to
any
influence
of
the
stock
market
.

The
December
contract
ended
with
a
loss
of
0.22
cent

a
pound
,
at
74.48
cents
.

Technical
considerations
following
the
hurricane
,
which
was
a
factor
in
the
market
Friday
,
caused
prices
to
decline
yesterday
,
said
Ernest
Simon
,
cotton
specialist
for
Prudential-Bache
Securities
,
New
York
.

Prices
rose
sharply
Friday
as
the
storm
approached
Texas
and
Louisiana
,
which
is
part
of
the
Mississippi
Delta
cotton-growing
area
.

However
,
after
absorbing
the
potential
effect
of
the
hurricane
,
prices
began
to
slip
late
Friday
,
Mr.
Simon
said
.

That
selling
continued
yesterday
and
kept
prices
under
pressure
,
he
said
.

Colder
weather
is
being
predicted
for
the
high
plains
of
Texas
and
the
northern
states
of
the
Delta
during
the
coming
weekend
,
Mr.
Simon
said
.

That
has
n't
yet
captured
traders
'
attention
,
he
added
.

SUGAR
:
Futures
prices
declined
.

The
March
contract
was
off
0.32
cent

a
pound
at
13.97
cents
.

At
one
point
in
early
trading
the
March
price
rose
to
as
high
as
14.22
cents
when
the
stock
market
recovered
,
but
the
price
then
fell
back
.

A
price-depressing
factor
,
one
analyst
said
,
was
that
India
,
which
had
been
expected
to
buy
around
200,000
tons
of
sugar
in
the
world
market
,
did
n't
make
any
purchases
.

India
recently
bought
200,000
tons
and
was
expected
to
buy
more
,
the
analyst
said
.

Another
analyst
thought
that
India
may
have
pulled
back
because
of
the
concern
over
the
stock
market
.

``
India
may
have
felt
that
if
there
was
a
severe
drop
in
the
stock
market
and
it
affected
sugar
,
it
could
buy
at
lower
prices
,
''
said
Judith
Ganes
,
analyst
for
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
,
New
York
.

At
any
rate
,
she
added
,
``
India
needs
the
sugar
,
so
it
will
be
in
sooner
or
later
to
buy
it
.

''

FARM
PRODUCTS
:
The
prices
of
cattle
and
hog
futures
contracts
dropped
sharply
because
traders
speculated
that
the
stock
market
plunge
Friday
will
linger
in
the
minds
of
U.S.
consumers
long
enough
to
prompt
them
to
rein
in
their
spending
at
the
supermarket
,
which
would
hurt
demand
for
beef
and
pork
.

The
price
of
the
hog
contract
for
October
delivery
dropped
its
maximum
permissible
daily
limit
of
1.5
cents

a
pound
.

The
prices
of
most
grain
futures
contracts
rose
slightly
yesterday
out
of
relief
that
the
stock
market
was
showing
signs
of
recovering
.

Earlier
in
the
session
,
the
prices
of
several
soybean
contracts
set
new
lows
.

A
broad
rally
began
when
several
major
processors
began
buying
futures
contracts
,
apparently
to
take
advantage
of
the
price
dip
.

In
an
attempt
to
give
new
momentum
to
European
Community
plans
for
a
single
currency
,
EC
government
leaders
are
likely
to
agree
to
set
a
date
for
starting
formal
talks
on
amending
the
EC
's
founding
Treaty
of
Rome
.

According
to
diplomatic
sources
in
Brussels
,
most
EC
leaders
agree
that
talks
should
begin
in
the
second

half
of
1990
,
and
will
make
a
declaration
on
that
during
a
summit
meeting
in
Strasbourg
,
France
,
on
Dec.
8
and
9
.

The
only
strong
opposition
to
changing
the
EC
treaty
comes
from
British
Prime
Minister
Margaret
Thatcher
,
who
is
opposed
to
creating
a
single
EC
currency
.

But
the
process
of
convening
the
intergovernmental
conference
does
n't
require
unanimity
.

Setting
a
date
to
start
treaty
negotiations
has
no
legal
significance
in
itself
,
but
could
be
viewed
as
an
important
psychological
push
.

French
President
Francois
Mitterrand
fought
to
set
a
date
for
the
conference
during
the
EC
summit
in
Madrid
last
June
,
but
the
move
was
scuttled
because
of
opposition
by
Mrs.
Thatcher
and
West
German
Chancellor
Helmut
Kohl
.

Diplomatic
sources
said
Mr.
Kohl
may
now
agree
to
set
a
date
for
the
conference
to
make
it
clear
that
West
Germany
is
still
committed
to
EC
unity
.

A
group
including
Jon
M.
Huntsman
of
Salt
Lake
City
,
said
it
boosted
its
stake
in
Aristech
Chemical
Corp.
to
8.36
%
of
the

the
common
shares
outstanding
.

As
previously
reported
,
Huntsman
Holdings
Corp.
,
owned
by
Jon
M.
Huntsman
and
other
members
of
his
family
,
proposed
that
Banstar
Corp.
,
an
affiliate
of
Huntsman
Holdings
,
acquire
Aristech
in
a
friendly
transaction
for
$
25-a-share
in
cash
,
or
$
817.5
million
.

In
a
filing
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
,
the
Huntsman
group
said
it
controls
2,720,675
Aristech
common
shares
,
including
306,000
shares
bought
from
Aug.
21
to
Oct.
13
for
$
20
to
$
20.875
per
share
.

Officials
at
Aristech
,
based
in
Pittsburgh
,
declined
comment
.

Laidlaw
Transportation
Ltd.
said
it
raised
its
stake
in
ADT
Ltd.
of
Bermuda
to
29.4
%
from

%
.

A
spokesman
for
Laidlaw
declined
to
disclose
the

paid
for
the
additional

,
which

he
said
were

``
over

of

''

The
spokesman
said
Laidlaw
would
n't
increase
its
stake
in
ADT
beyond
30
%
``
without
a
great
deal
of
thought
''
because
of
British
takeover
regulations

that
require
a
company
acquiring
more
than
30
%
to
extend
an
offer
to
the
rest
of
the

The

improved

to

and
higher

or

from

The
sudden
``
flight
to
quality
''
that
triggered
Friday
's
explosive
bond-market
rally
was
reversed
yesterday
in
a
``
flight
from
quality
''
rout
.

The
setback
,
in
which
Treasury
bond
prices
plummeted
,
reflected
a
rebound
in
the
stock
market
and
profit-taking
.

``
It
was
a
pretty
wild
day
.

Our
markets
were
closely
tied
to
the
stock
market
,
''
said
Joel
Kazis
,
manager
of
trading
at
Smith
Barney
,
Harris
Upham
&
Co
.


``
Friday
's
flight
to
quality
was
no
longer
needed
once
the
stock
market
found
its
legs
,
''
he
said
.

Some
fixed-income
investors
had
expected
a
further
drop
in
stock
prices
after
the
nearly
200-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
on
Friday
.

That
caused
investors
to
flee
stocks
and
buy
high-quality
Treasury
bonds
,
which
are
safer
than
other
types
of
securities
.

But
when
stocks
began
to
climb
instead
,
prices
of
Treasury
bonds
declined
.

Contributing
to
the
selling
pressure
were
dispatches
by
several
investment
firms
advising
clients
to
boost
their
stock
holdings
and
reduce
the
size
of
their
cash
or
bond
portfolios
.

Among
the
firms
were
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
and
Dean
Witter
Reynolds
Inc
.

The
bond
market
seemed
to
ignore
evidence
that
the
Federal
Reserve
eased
credit
conditions
slightly
by
allowing
the
federal
funds
rate
to
drift
as
low
as
8
%
.

The
closely
watched
rate
on
federal
funds
,
or
overnight
loans
between
banks
,
slid
to
about
8
%
last
week
,
down
from
its
perceived
target
level
of
about
9
%
.

The
rate
is
considered
an
early
signal
of
changes
in
Fed
policy
.

Traders
said
yesterday
's
modest
easing
did
n't
stir
much
enthusiasm
because
it
had
been
widely
expected
.

In
fact
,
some
economists
contend
that
the
latest
easing
started
last
week
.

Others
note
that
some
investors
were
disappointed
because
they
had
expected
a
more
aggressive
easing
.

The
Treasury
's
benchmark
30-year
bond
,
ended
about
1
points
lower
,
or
down
about
$
17.50
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
.

The
reversal
was
even
more
evident
among
shorter-term
Treasury
securities
.

After
Treasury
bill
rates
plummeted
as
much
as
0.70
percentage
point
on
Friday
,
they
gave
back
three-fourths
of
that
amount
yesterday
.

The
bond-equivalent
yield
on
three-month
Treasury
bills
,
for
example
,
was
quoted
late
yesterday
at
7.72
%
,
compared
with
7.16
%
Friday
.

Investment-grade
corporate
bonds
,
mortgage-backed
securities
and
municipal
bonds
also
fell
.

But
prices
of
junk
bonds
,
which
were
battered
Friday
in
near
standstill
trading
,
rebounded
to
post
small
gains
after
a
volatile
trading
session
.

Junk
bonds
opened
as
much
as
four
points
lower
but
staged
a
modest
comeback
as
stock
prices
firmed
.

Some
traders
said
the
high-yield
market
was
helped
by
active
institutional
buying
.

In
particular
,
they
said
,
firms
such
as
First
Boston
Corp.
and
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc.
began
making
a
market
in
junk
issues
early
in
the
session
when
prices
hit
severely
depressed
levels
.

``
I
think
the
willingness
of
securities
companies
to
make
markets
for
high-yield
issues
improved
the
sentiment
for
junk
bonds
,
''
said
John
Lonski
,
an
economist
at
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc
.

U.S.
Treasury
bonds
were
higher
in
overnight
trading
in
Japan
,
which
opened
at
about
7:30
p.m.
EDT
.

The
benchmark
30-year
bond
,
for
example
rose
one
point
in
early
Japanese
trading
in
reaction
to
a
quick
600-point
drop
in
the
Tokyo
stock
market
.

But
as
Japanese
stocks
rebounded
,
Treasurys
retreated
and
ended
just
modestly
higher
.

Many
U.S.
trading
operations
,
wanting
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
on
Japanese
trading
as
an
indication
of
where
U.S.
trading
would
begin
,
were
fully
staffed
during
the
Tokyo
trading
session
.

``
Most
of
the
action
was
during
the
night
session
,
''
said
Michael
Moore
,
trading
manager
at
Continental
Bank
.

Jay
Goldinger
,
who
often
trades
overnight
for
Capital
Insight
Inc.
,
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif.
,
said
trading
in
Tokyo
was
``
very
active
''
but
highly
volatile
.

``
We
went
down
point
in
10
minutes
right
before
lunch
,
then
after
lunch

we
went
up
point
in
12
minutes
,
''
he
said
.

In
Tokyo
,
trading
is
halted
during
lunchtime
.

Tokyo
's
market
turned
out
to
be
a
bad
bellwether
for
U.S.
trading
.

When
the
market
opened
here
,
bonds
prices
fell
as
the
stock
market
regained
strength
.

The
bond
market
's
focus
on
stock
activity
was
so
strong
yesterday
that
it
overshadowed
today
's
slate
of
economic
data
,
which
includes
the
government
's
report
on
August
U.S.
merchandise
trade
and
September
industrial
production
.

Industrial
production
is
expected
to
have
declined
0.2
%
,
according
to
a
consensus
of
economists
surveyed
by
Dow
Jones
Capital
Markets
Report
.

The
August
trade
deficit
is
expected
to
have
widened
to
$
9.1
billion
from
$
7.58
billion
in
July
.

A
widening
of
that
magnitude
,
said
one
New
York
trader
,
is
``
not
a
favorable
number
...
.

It
could
do
damage
to
us
.

''

Meanwhile
,
agency
supply
is
expected
to
weigh
heavily
on
the
market
today
when
the
Federal
Home
Loan
Bank
prices
a
$
2.3
billion
offering
of
one-year
,
three-year
,
five-year
and
10-year
maturities
.

Tomorrow
,
the
Resolution
Funding
Corp.
will
provide
details
of
its
first
bond
issue
,
which
is
expected
to
total
between
$
4
billion
and
$
6
billion
and
carry
a
maturity
greater
than
20
years
.

Resolution
Funding
is
a
division
of
Resolution
Trust
Corp.
,
the
new
federal
agency
created
to
bail
out
the
nation
's
troubled
thrifts
.

And
this
week

the
Tennessee
Valley
Authority
plans
to
price
a
$
3
billion
offering
,
its
first
public
debt
borrowing
in
15
years
.

``
There

's
lots
of
supply
,
''
the
New
York
trader
said
.

``
We
have
a
couple
or
three
tough
weeks
coming
.

Treasury
Securities

Prices
of
Treasury
bonds
tumbled
in
moderate
to
active
trading
.

The
benchmark
30-year
Treasury
bond
was
quoted
late
at
a
price
of
101
,
compared
with
a
closing
price
of
103
Friday
.

The
yield
on
the
benchmark
issue
rose
to
7.97
%
from
7.82
%
.

The
latest
10-year
notes
were
quoted
late
at
100
for
a
yield
of
7.97
%
,
compared
with
101
to
yield
7.84
%
.

Short-term
interest
rates
fell
yesterday
at
the
government
's
weekly
Treasury
bill
auction
.

The
average
discount
rate
on
new
three-month
Treasury
bills
was
7.37
%
,
the
lowest
since
the
average
of
7.36
%
at
the
auction
on
Oct.
17
,
1988
.

The
average
discount
rate
was
7.42
%
on
new
six-month
bills
,
the
lowest
since
the
average
of
7.35
%
at
the
auction
on
July
31
,
1989
.

Here
are
auction
details
:

Rates
are
determined
by
the
difference
between
the
purchase
price
and
face
value
.

Thus
,
higher
bidding
narrows
the
investor
's
return
while
lower
bidding
widens
it
.

The
percentage
rates
are
calculated
on
a
360-day
year
,
while
the
coupon-equivalent
yield
is
based
on
a
365-day
year
.

Both

issues
are
dated
Oct.
19
.

The

Corporate
Issues

Investment-grade
corporate
bonds
ended
one
to
1
point
lower
.

There
were
no
new
issues
.

Foreign
Bonds

Foreign
bonds
surged
as
the
dollar
weakened
against
most
major
currencies
.

Among
benchmark
issues
:

--
Japan
's

4.6

due
1998
ended
on

screens
at

.

The

,
while
the
11

due
1991
rose
to

to
yield

.

Mortgage-Backed
Securities

Mortgage
securities
gave
up
most
of
Friday
's
gains
as
active
issues
ended
to
point
lower
.

Dealers
said
morning
activity
was
hectic
as
prices
dropped
in
response
to
gains
in
the
stock
market
and
losses
in
Treasury
securities
,
but
trading
slowed
to
moderate
levels
in
the
afternoon
.

Government
National
Mortgage
Association
9
%
securities
for
November
delivery
were
quoted
late
yesterday
at
98
,
down
from
Friday
;
9
%
securities
were
down
at
100
;
and
10
%
securities
were
at
102
,
off
.

Federal
Home
Loan
Mortgage
Corp.
9
%
securities
were
at
97
,
down
.

On
Friday
,
mortgage
issues
gained
as
much
as
1
.

Late
yesterday
Ginnie
Mae
9
%
securities
were
yielding
9.39
%
to
a
12-year
average
life
assumption
,
as
the
spread
above
the
Treasury
10-year
note
narrowed
0.01
percentage
point
to
1.42
.

Traders
said
there
were
some
busy
dealings
in
Freddie
Mac
and
Federal
National
Mortgage
Association
securities
because
underwriters
from
last
week
's
heavy
slate
of
real
estate
mortgage
investment
conduit
issues
moved
to
gather
collateral
for
new
deals
.

Offsetting

the
Remic-related
purchases
were
continued
heavy
sales
by
mortgage
originators
,
which
are
producing
increased
amounts
of
fixed-rate
mortgage-backed
issues
with
lower
rates
.

There
was
no
new-issue
activity
in
the
derivative
market
.

Municipals

Rebounding
stocks
and
weaker
Treasury
prices
drove
municipal
bonds
to
point
lower
in
late
dealings
.

The
session
losses
left
municipal
dollar
bonds
close
to
where
they
were
before
the
190.58-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
Friday
prompted
a
capital
markets
rally
.

Trading
was
hectic
during
the
morning
,
with
players
trying
to
gauge
whether
equities
would
continue
Friday
's
free
fall
or
stabilize
after
a
brief
spot
of
weakness
.

Tax-exempts
started
the
session
flat
to
a
touch
higher
on
anticipation
of
further
stock
market
erosion
,
but
bond
prices
rapidly
turned
south
as
it
became
more
clear
that
a
repeat
of
the
October
1987
crash
was
n't
at
hand
.

Professionals
dominated
municipal
trading
throughout
the
session
.

Traders
said
retail
investors
seemed
to
be
hugging
the
sidelines
until
a
measure
of
volatility
is
wrung
out
of
the
market
.

New
Jersey
Turnpike
Authority
's
7.20
%
issue
of
2018
was
off
at
98
bid
,
yielding
7.32
%
,
up
0.07
percentage
point
from
late
Friday
.

Florida
Board
of
Education
's
7
%
issue
of
2023
was
point
weaker
at
99
bid
.

The
7
%
issue
of
Triborough
Bridge
and
Tunnel
Authority
of
New
York
,
due
2019
,
was
off
at
98
bid
.

And
Fairfax
County
,
Va.
,
Water
Authority
's
7
%
issue
of
2027
was
down
at
99
bid
.

Serial
bond
yields
were
up
about
0.05
percentage
point
.

British
retail
sales
volume
rose
a
provisional
0.4
%
in
September
from
August
and
was
up
2.2
%
from
September
1988
,
the
Department
of
Trade
and
Industry
said
.

For
the
three
months
ended
in
September
,
retail
sales
volume
was
down
0.5
%
from
the
previous
three
months
and
up
1.2
%
from
a
year
earlier
.

What
does
n't
belong
here
?

A.
manual
typewriters
,

B.
black-and-white
snapshots
,

C.
radio
adventure
shows
.

If
you
guessed
black-and-white
snapshots
,
you
're
right
.

After
years
of
fading
into
the
background
,
two-tone
photography
is
coming
back
.

Trendy
magazine
advertisements
feature
stark
black-and-white
photos
of
Hollywood
celebrities
pitching
jeans
,
shoes
and
liquor
.

Portrait
studios
accustomed
to
shooting
only
in
color
report
a
rush
to
black-and-white
portrait
orders
.

And
black-and-white
photography
classes
are
crowded
with
students
.

What
's
happening
in
photography
mirrors
the
popularity
of
black
and
white
in
fashion
,
home
furnishings
and
cinematography
.

On
Seventh
Avenue
,
designers
have
been
advancing
the
monochrome
look
with
clothing
collections
done
entirely
in
black
and
white
.

And
classic
black-and-white
movies
are
enjoying
a
comeback
on
videocassette
tapes
,
spurred
,
in
part
,
by
the
backlash
against
colorization
of
old
films
.

``
The
pendulum
is
swinging
back
to
black
and
white
,
''
says
Richard
DeMoulin
,
the
general
manager
of
Eastman
Kodak
Co.
's
professional
photography
division
.

Until
two
years
ago
,
sales
of
black-and-white
film
had
been
declining
steadily
since
the
1960s
.

But
last
year
,
buoyed
by
increased
use
in
advertising
and
other
commercial
applications
,
sales
increased
5
%
,
and
they
are
expected
to
jump
at
least
that
much
again
this
year
.

Photographic
companies
are
scrambling
to
tap
the
resurging
market
,
reviving
some
black-and-white
product
lines
and
developing
new
ones
.

At
Kodak
,
which
largely
ignored
the
market
for
years
,
black-and-white
film
sales
now
account
for
nearly
15
%
of
the
company
's
$
3
billion
in
film
and
paper
sales
annually
,
up
from
10
%
three
years
ago
.

The
Rochester
,
N.Y.
,
photographic
giant
recently
began
marketing
T-Max
3200
,
one
of
the
fastest
and
most
sensitive
monochrome
films
.

Aimed
at
commercial
photographers
,
the
film
can
be
used
in
very
low
light
without
sacrificing
quality
,
says
Donald
Franz
of
Photofinishing
Newsletter
.

Also
trying
to
snare
a
portion
of
the
$
2
billion-a-year
industry
is
Agfa
Corp.
,
a
unit
of
Bayer
AG
.

Agfa
recently
signed
Olympic
gold
medalist
Florence
Griffith-Joyner
to
endorse
a
new
line
of
black-and-white
paper

that
's
geared
to
consumers
and
will
compete
directly
with
Kodak
's
papers
.

Slated
for
market
by
the
end
of
the
year
,
the
paper
``
could
have
been
introduced
a
long
time
ago
but
the
market
was
n't
there
then
,
''
says
an
Agfa
spokesman
.

The
biggest
beneficiary
of
the
black-and-white
revival
is
likely
to
be
International
Paper
Co.
's
Ilford
division
,
known
in
the
industry
for
its
premium
products
.

Sales
of
Ilford
's
four
varieties
of
black-and-white
film

this
year
are
outpacing
growth
in
the
overall
market
,
although
the
company
wo
n't
say
by
exactly
how
much
.

``
We
hope
the
trend
lasts
,
''
says
Laurie
DiCara
,
Ilford
's

Why
all
the
interest
?

For
baby
boomers

who
grew
up
being
photographed
in
color
,
black
and
white
seems
eye-catching
and
exotic
.

``
It
has
an
archival
,
almost
nostalgic
quality
to
it
,
''
says
Owen
B.
Butler
,
the
chairman
of
the
applied
photography
department
at
Rochester
Institute
of
Technology
.

``
You
can
shift
out
of
reality
with
black
and
white
,
''
he
adds
.

Such
features
have
been
especially
attractive
to
professional
photographers
and
marketing
executives
,
who
have
been
steadily
increasing
their
use
of
black
and
white
in
advertising
.

Processing
of
black-and-white
commercial
film
jumped
24
%
last
year
to
18.7
million
rolls
.

Consider
Gap
Inc.
,
whose
latest
ad
campaign
features
black-and-white
shots
of
Hollywood
stars
,
artists
and
other
well-known
personalities
modeling
the
retailer
's
jeans
and
T-shirts
.

Richard
Crisman
,
the
account
manager
for
the
campaign
,
says
Gap
did
n't
intentionally
choose
black
and
white
to
distinguish
its
ads
from
the
color
spreads
of
competitors
.

``
We
wanted
to
highlight
the
individual
,
not
the
environment
,
''
he
says
,
``
and
black
and
white
allows
you
to
do
that
better
than
color
.

''
The
campaign
won
a
Cleo
award
as
this
year
's
best
ad
by
a
specialty
retailer
.

Even
food
products
and
automobiles
,
which
have
long
depended
on
color
,
are
making
the
switch
.

Companies
``
feel
black
and
white
will
convey
a
stronger
statement
,
''
says
Marc
L.
Hauser
,
a
Chicago
photographer

who
is
working
on
a
black-and-white
print
ad
for
Stouffer
Food
Corp.
's
Lean
Cuisine
.

Other
companies

that
are
currently
using
two-tone
ads
include
American
Express
Co.
and
Epson
America
Inc
.

Portrait
studios
have
also
latched
onto
the
trend
.

Using
black
and
white
,
``
we
can
make
housewives
look
like
stars
,
''
says
John
Perrin
.

His
On-Broadway
Photography
studio
in
Portland
,
Ore.
,
doubled
its
business
last
year
and
,
he
says
,
is
booked
solid
for
the
next
five
.

One
customer
,
Dayna
Brunsdon
,
says
she
spurned
a
color
portrait
for
black
and
white
because
``
it
's
more
dramatic
.

I
show
it
to
my
friends
,
and
they

all
say
`
wow
.

'
It
is
n't
ordinary
like
color
.

''

Still
,
most
consumers
are
n't
plunking
black-and-white
film
into
their
cameras
to
take
family
snapshots
.

One
big
obstacle
is
that
few
drugstores
develop
the
film
anymore
.

Typically
,
it
must
be
mailed
to
a
handful
of
processors
and
may
take
a
week
or
more
to
be
processed
and
returned
.

Black-and-white
film
costs
consumers

a
little
less
than
color
film
,
and
processing
costs
the
same
.

But
for
photofinishers
,
developing
costs
for
black-and-white
film
are
higher
.

Some
companies
are
starting
to
tackle
that
problem
.

Ilford
,
for
example
,
recently
introduced
a
black-and-white
film

that
can
be
processed
quickly
by
color
labs
.

Intent
on
wooing
customers
,
the
company
is
also
increasing
its
sponsorship
of
black-and-white
photography
classes
.

Similarly
,
Agfa
is
sponsoring
scores
of
photography
contests
at
high
schools
and
colleges
,
offering
free
black-and-white
film
and
paper
as
prizes
.

And
Kodak
is
distributing
an
instructional
video
to
processors
on
how
to
develop
its
monochrome
film
more
efficiently
.

Other
companies
are
introducing
related
products
.

Charles
Beseler
Co.
,
a
leading
maker
of
photographic
enlargers
,
introduced
last
month

a
complete
darkroom
starter
kit
targeted
at
teen-agers

who
want
to
process
their
own
black-and-white
photographs
.

The
kit
,
which
has
a
suggested
retail
price
of
$
250
and
has
already
become
a
bestseller
,
was
introduced
after
retailers
noticed
numerous
requests
from
parents
for
children
's
photography
equipment
.

``
It
seems
computers
as
hobbies
have
waned
,
''
says
Ian
Brightman
,
Beseler
's
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
.

But
some
industry
observers
believe
the
resurgence
of
black
and
white
is
only
a
fad
.

They
cite
the
emergence
of
still
electronic
photography
,
more
newspapers
turning
to
color
on
their
pages
and
measurable
improvements
in
the
quality
of
color
prints
.

``
Black
and
white
has
n't
made
the
same
quantum
leaps
in
technological
development
as
color
,
''
says
Mr.
Butler
of
the
Rochester
Institute
.

``
The
color
print
today
is
far
superior
to
prints
of
10
years
ago
.

You
ca
n't
say
the
same
with
black
and
white
.

''

But
when
Popular
Photography
,
a
leading
magazine
for
photographers
,
selected
15
of
the
greatest
photos
ever
made
for
its
latest
issue
celebrating
photography
's
150th
anniversary
,
all
were
black
and
white
.

``
It
's
got
a
classic
spirit
and
carries
over
emotionally
,
''
says
Alfred
DeBat
of
Professional
Photographers
of
America
.

``
That
's
the
appeal
.

''


Gitano
Group
Inc.
said
it
agreed
to
buy
50
%
of
Regatta
Sport
Ltd.
,
a
closely
held
apparel
maker
,
with
the
assumption
of
$
3
million
of
contingent
debt
.

Under
the
terms
of
the
contract
,
New
York-based
Gitano
has
the
option
to
acquire
the
remaining
50
%
of
Regatta
,
a
maker
of
men
's
and
women
's
clothes
sold
primarily
in
department
stores
,
under
certain
conditions
.

That
50
%
is
now
held
by
Clifford
Parker
,
Regatta
's
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
who
will
continue
to
manage
Regatta
's
operations
under
Gitano
.

In
1989
,
Regatta
will
have
sales
``
in
excess
of
$
10
million
''
and
will
show
a
profit
,
Mr.
Parker
said
.

Gitano
,
which
makes
budget-priced
apparel
sold
mainly
through
mass
merchandisers
like
K
mart
and
Wal-Mart
,
said
the
Regatta
acquisition
will
enhance
its
strategy
to
expand
into
department
stores
.

This
fall
,
Gitano
began
manufacturing
moderately
priced
clothes
aimed
at
department
stores
under
the
Gloria
Vanderbilt
trademark
,
which

Gitano
recently
acquired
.

U.S.
Banknote
Co.
said
it
again
extended
the
expiration
date
of
its
$
7-a-share
tender
offer
for
International
Banknote
Co.
to
Nov.
15
.

U.S.
Banknote
said
it
is
in
negotiations
to
sell
``
certain
facilities
,
''
which

it
did
n't
name
,
to
a
third
party
,
and
it
needs
the
extension
to
try
to
reach
a
definitive
agreement
on
the
sale
.

U.S.
Banknote
said
it
believes
the
sale
,
if
completed
,
apparently
would
satisfy
antitrust
issues
raised
by
the
U.S.
Justice
Department
about
U.S.
Banknote
's
offer
to
buy
International
Banknote
.

Both
of
the
New
York-based
companies
print
stock
certificates
and
currency
.

U.S.
Banknote
said
``
there
can
be
no
assurance
''
a
sale
agreement
would
be
concluded
.

It
also
said
the
tender
offer
would
probably
have
to
be
extended
further
to
complete
financing
arrangements
.

U.S.
Banknote
said
Citibank
extended
the
expiration
date
of
its
commitment
for
senior
secured
financing
to
Nov.
15
.

The
offer
,
made
June
1
,
has
been
extended
several
times
.

Closely
held
U.S.
Banknote
offered
the
$
7

a
share
,
or
$
126
million
,
for
as
many
as
14.9
million
shares
,
or
78.6
%
,
of
International
Banknote
's
shares
outstanding
.

U.S.
Banknote
said
that
as
of
Oct.
13
,
16.1
million
shares
,
or
about
84.3
%
of
the
fully
diluted
shares
outstanding
,
had
been
tendered
.

The
latest
crewcut
in
the
equities
markets
reminds
me
of
the
joke
T.
Boone
Pickens
tells
about
the
guy

who
was
run
over
by
the
parade
.

When
asked
``
What
went
wrong
?
''
the
unfortunate
victim
replied
,
``
It
was
a
combination
of
things
.

''
And
so
it
was
on
Gray
Friday
.

The
grand
marshal
of
this
parade
would
appear
to
have
been
excess
leverage
.

Even
if
that
is
so
,
however
,
it
's
probably
the
case
that
no
barriers
should
have
been
erected
to
stop
the
procession
before
the
end
of
the
rout
(
e
)
.

The
ceremonies
began
Friday
afternoon
when
word
spread
that
the
UAL
buy-out
was
collapsing
.

Although
the
union-bidder
expects
to
patch
together
a
substitute
offer
,
consisting
of
less
cash
,
the
failure
to
get
cash
from
Japanese
and
American
banks
confirmed
a
growing
fear
among
arbitragers
that
the
pageant
of
high-leverage
takeover
deals
is
ending
.

Lots
of
other
entries
made
up
the
parade
,
of
course
--
notably
a
surprisingly
large
increase
in
producer
prices
,
signalling
Federal
Reserve
tightness
;
and
the
Bush
administration
's
(
temporary
?

)
defeat
in
trying
to
lower
the
capital-gains
tax
.

As
usual
,
few
favorable
reviews
were
heard
for
that
ever-present
marching
band
of
program
traders
,
although
most
serious
studies
suggest
they
only
play
the
music
that
others
write
.

What
really
spooked
the
crowds
along
Wall
Street
,
however
,
was
the
sudden
concern
that
,
whatever

the
reason
,
the
pool
of
debt
capital
is
drying
up
.

Gray
Friday
reflects
a
panic
mainly
by
the
takeover
arbitragers
,
rather
than
the
small
investor
,
as
their
highly
margined
investments
in
the
``
deal
''
stocks
are
jeopardized
by
the
unexpected
drying
up
of
the
lubricant
for
deal
financing
.

Deal
stocks
led
the
market
down
as
they
absorbed
the
heaviest
losses
.

UAL
,
which
triggered
the
slide
,
opened
Monday
at
$
224
,
down
about
20
%
from
Thursday
's
close
.

AMR
opened
Monday
at
$
80
,
down
nearly
20
%
from
Thursday
's
close
.

(
Both
took
further
hits
yesterday
.

)
Hilton
lost
20
%
on
Friday
;
Paramount
lost
almost
11
%
.

A
careful
look
reveals
that
where
deal
financing
has
been
secured
,
the
target
's
stock
price
was
not
affected
on
Friday
.

The
multibillion-dollar
prospects
,
where
the
bidder
must
line
up
a
consortium
of
banks
issue
billions
in
high-yield
debt
,
were
where
the
damage
was
concentrated
.

The
market
for
so-called
junk
bonds
has
been
setting
the
stage
for
Friday
's
dramatic
march
for
several
weeks
.

The
growing
financial
difficulties
of
recent
high-leverage
restructurings
or
takeovers
,
such
as
Resorts
International
,
Integrated
Resources
,
and
Campeau
's
retailing
empire
,
have
cast
a
pall
over
the
entire
market
for
high-yield
securities
.

Investors
have
reacted
by
ignoring
recent
efforts
to
float
junk
bonds
by
Ohio
Mattress
and
by
forcing
Ramada
to
postpone
indefinitely
its
planned
junk-bond
sale
and
restructuring
.

As
a
result
,
high-yield
mutual
funds
have
declined
across
the
board
and
the
many
firms
planning
to
sell
$
11
billion
in
junk
bonds
before
year-end
are
experiencing
anxious
times
.

These
are
all
market
excesses
(
putting
aside
the
artificial
boosts
that
the
tax
code
gives
to
debt
over
equity
)
,
and
what

we
've
seen
is
the
market
reining
them
in
.

Of
course
,
Washington
had
n't
been
silent
in
the
days
leading
up
to
the
debacle
,
and
its
tendency
to
meddle
in
the
leverage
equation
remains
a
troublesome
prospect
,
but
those
preliminary
steps
should
n't
distract
us
from
the
basic
market
fundamentalism

that
was
at
work
on
Friday
.

If
it
is
correct
to
find
that
concerns
over
corporate
debt
and
LBOs
caused
Gray
Friday
,
what
are
the
implications
for
policy
makers
?

After
all
,
the
stock
market
's
response
to
the
collapse
of
the
UAL
deal
might
be
taken
to
confirm
the
anti-debt
direction
of
regulators
.

Is
this
a
case
where
private
markets
are
approving
of
Washington
's
bashing
of
Wall
Street
?

Absolutely
not
.

To
the
extent
that
Friday
's
sell-off
reflected
a
sudden
reappraisal
of
the
excesses
of
leverage
,
the
message
is
that
Wall
Street
and
the
private
markets
are
fully
capable
of
imposing
the
appropriate
incentives
and
sanctions
on
corporate
behavior
.

The
national
economic
interests
are
much
better
served
allowing
the
private
interests
of
bankers
and
investors
be
the
ultimate
judges
of
the
investment
quality
of
various
LBO
deals
and
leveraged
restructurings
.

The
recent
difficulties
in
the
junk-bond
markets
and
the
scarcity
of
bank
capital
for
recent
deals
underscores
the
wisdom
of
letting
the
free
markets
operate
.

If
takeover
premiums
become
excessive
,
if
LBO
dealmakers
become
too
aggressive
,
then
the
private
market
will
recognize
these
problems
more
quickly
and
accurately
than
will
policy
makers
,
and
the
markets
will
move
with
lightning
speed
to
impose
appropriate
sanctions
.

Yes
,
the
broader
exchanges
got
caught
up
in
the
spiral
,
but
they
rode
the
tiger
up
all
year
.

Not
surprisingly
,
he
sometimes
bites
.

The
arbitragers
and
takeover
initiatiors
got
killed
on
Gray
Friday
,
while
the
besieged
managers
of
prospective
targets
cheered
lustily
.

If
you
identify
with
the
besieged
managers
,
you
must
concede
that
speedy
and
effective
relief
from
the
excesses
of
the
takeover
market
is
more
likely
to
come
from
the
marketplace
than
from
Washington
.

If
you
side
with
the
arbitragers
and
raiders
,
you
clearly
have
more
to
fear
from
private
investors
than
from
regulators
,
although
the
Delaware
courts
should
never
be
underestimated
.

The
truth
is
,
Washington
understands
politics
better
than
economics
.

Although
the
average
citizen
is
probably
not
harmed
too
much
from
Washington
's
rhetorical
war
against
Wall
Street
regarding
excessive
financial
leveraging
,
actual
legislation
would
probably
impose
considerable
harm
.

Any
such
attempt
to
distinguish
``
good
debt
''
from
``
bad
debt
,
''
or
to
draw
the
line
at
a
particular
industry
,
such
as
the
airlines
,
is
likely
to
blunt
the
spur
that
the
proper
amount
of
leverage
provides
both
to
equity
markets
and
economic
efficiency
in
general
.

Far
better
for
policy
makers
to
concentrate
on
the
war
against
drugs
,
Panama
and
the
deficit
,
all
of
them
parades

that
seem
never
to
end
.

Mr.
Jarrell
,
former
top
economist
at
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
,
teaches
at
the
University
of
Rochester
's
Simon
Business
School
.

Congressman
Lee
Hamilton
,
an
Indiana
Democrat

who
chairs
the

the
Joint
Economic
Committee
,
plans
hearings
next
week
on
his
bill
to
subject
the
Fed
to
greater
political
control
.

The
Fed
already
is
experiencing
political
pressure
to
supply
lower
interest
rates
and
easy
money
.

Former
Senator
William
Proxmire
has
called
the
Hamilton
bill

the
most
dangerous
economic
legislation
now
before
Congress
,
because
it
would
give
U.S.
economic
policy

a
further
inflationary
bias
.

It
is
n't
given
much
chance
of
passing
,
but
its
mere
existence
is
cause
for
anxiety
.

The
U.S.
and
the
world
are
not
in
need
of
new
doubts
about
the
future
soundness
of
the
dollar
.

Attempts
in
late
September
to
drive
the
dollar
down
through
central
bank
interventions
were
ill-timed
,
particularly
since
we
now
know
that
the
dollar
was
then
in
the
process
of
taking
another
dive
relative
to
oil
and
other
producer
goods
.

The
sharp
rise
in
the
September
Producer-Price
Index
announced
Friday
fueled
the
stock
market
debacle
.

The
Hamilton
bill
would
put
the
Treasury
Secretary
on
the
Fed
's
board
and
Open
Market
Committee
,
which
charts
monetary
policy
.

More
worrisome
,
Congress
would
have
a
stronger
supervisory
role
,
with
the
Fed
audited
by
the
General
Accounting
Office
,
which

Congress
runs
.

Those
sound
like
innocuous
changes
,
but
they
're
not
.

Both

the
Treasury
and
Congress
traditionally
have
pushed
for
easy
money
,
the
Treasury
to
reduce
its
debt
management
problems
and
Congress
to
satisfy
powerful
producer
constituencies

who
want
a
weak
dollar
for
short-term
competitive
gains
in
world
markets
.

Congressional
pressures
on
the
Fed
similar
to
those

that
produced
the
savings
and
loan
mess
are
an
awful
thought
.

Even
now
,
the
Fed
can
not
simply
thumb
its
nose
at
the
President
and
Congress
.

But
it
can
resist
.

Paul
Volcker
found
subtle
ways
to
take
his
case
to
the
people
,
with
good
results
.

Easy
money
advocates
,
however
,
are
adept
at
spreading
economic
myths
.

There
is
the
constant
insistence
that
the
Fed
could
lower
interest
rates
were
it
not
so
obstinate
.

The
Fed
indeed
can
lower
short-term
interest
rates
by
pumping
reserves
into
the
banks
,
but
it
ca
n't
do
much
about
them
from
there
on
.

If
the
reserves
generate
inflation
,
which
is
what

the
Fed
fears
most
right
now
,
interest
rates
will
go
up
as
lenders
demand
a
premium
.

Enough
inflation
can
ultimately
even
wipe
out
the
bond
market
,
as
it
did
in
Britain
in
the
1970s
,
thereby
crippling
the
economy
.

The
other
myth
is
that
inflation
generates
economic
growth
.

It
may
do
that
temporarily
but
it
also
sows
the
seeds
for
stagnation
.

These
two
myths
have
caused
the
republic
untold
damage
.

The
U.S.
economy
took
on
an
inflationary
bias
when
the
Fed
was
forced
to
finance
an
incredible
spending
spree
by
Lyndon
Johnson
.

Richard
Nixon
exacerbated
the
problem
when
,
in
response
to
pressures
from
Congress
,
he
applied
price
and
wage
controls
in
August
1971
,
thereby
discouraging
production
.

Jimmy
Carter
ultimately
hired
Mr.
Volcker
to
kill
inflation
,
which
was
reaching
dangerous
levels
.

He
did
,
too
late
to
save
Mr.
Carter
from
forced
retirement
.

But
all
that
was
a
long
time
ago
and
politicians
have
a
way
of
forgetting
such
things
.

The
1970s
inflation
yielded
great
benefits
to
some
producer
interests
,
including
Arab
sheiks
,
at
the
expense
of
the
American
middle
class
.

It
was
a
classic
example
of
how
inflation
transfers
income
to
the
wealthy
from
the
middle
class
.

That
explains
why
there
are
always
powerful
political
interests
pushing
for
a
soft
currency
.

In
some
countries
,
Argentina
for
example
,
those
interests
have
overwhelmed
the
government
and
what
remains
of
a
middle
class
.

The
claim

that
inflation
generates
economic
growth
is
seductive
.

In
fact

it
does
the
opposite
.

As
the
charts
show
,
the
1975-80
inflation
destroyed
both
productivity
and
economic
growth
(
see
accompanying
charts
--
WSJ
Oct.
17
,
1989
)
.

It
was
only
after
Mr.
Volcker
killed
inflation
,
at
the
cost
of
a
sharp
but
brief
recession
,
that
growth
and
productivity
started
rising
once
more
.

Producers
were
forced
by
the
discipline
of
sound
money
to
slash
away
organizational
fat
and
acquire
more
efficient
equipment
.

After
having
performed
that
admirable
feat
,
however
,
they
were
back
in
1985
demanding
a
dollar
devaluation

that
would
make
it
still
easier
for
them
to
compete
in
international
markets
.

They
got
the
devaluation
and
,
as
is
usually
the
case
,
began
picking
up
fat
again
.

So
now
they
want
another
one
.

Many
corporate
executives
do
n't
understand
or
do
n't
want
to
understand
that
their
own
companies
eventually
become
victims
of
such
policies
.

Inflation
destroys
capital
investment
.

Corporate
depreciation
reserves
lose
value
relative
to
equipment
replacement
costs
.

Investors
are
reluctant
to
invest
long
term
.

Corporations
,
in
effect
,
decapitalize
themselves
.

That
was
reflected
in
the
stagnant
stock
market
of
the
1970s
.

Strikes
increase
as
workers
demand
raises
to
cope
with
rising
prices
,
make
up
for
what

they
already
have
lost
and
hedge
against
what

they
will
lose
in
the
months
ahead
.

Productivity
falls
,
and
weaker
production
further
fans
inflation
.

The
middle
class
gets
poorer
,
and
the
poor
feel
greater
pain
than
ever
.

All
of
which
explains
why
stock
and
foreign
exchange
markets
get
jittery
when
the
Fed
comes
under
political
pressure
.

Particularly
so
when
it
comes
at
a
time
when
the
Fed
has
done
well
.

When
it
tightened
up
last
spring
,
the
price
indexes
fell
and
the
economy
began
to
pick
up
speed
again
,
which
is
of
course
exactly
counter
to
the
``
inflation-fuels-growth
''
theory
.

But
not
all
the
news
is
bad
.

Rep.
Stephen
Neal
(
D.
,
N.C
.

)
wants
Congress
to
instruct
the
Fed
to
do
one

thing
:
prevent
inflation
.

Nothing
could
be
more
to
the
point
.

If
one
thing
was
clear
in
the
chaos
of
Friday
's
market
sell-off
,
it
was
that
the
collapse
of
the
buy-out
of
UAL
Corp.
set
the
whole
thing
off
.

But
,
it
turns
out
,
Wall
Street
--
quick
to
read
tea
leaves
and
quick
to
panic
--
may
have
reached
the
wrong
conclusion
about
the
buy-out
's
unraveling
.

As
word
spread
Friday
that
many
of
the
world
's
biggest
banks
had
refused
to
participate
in
the
$
6.79
billion
leveraged
transaction
,
the
financial
markets
assumed
the
worst
:
If
the
management
of
a
blue-chip
outfit
like
the
parent
of
United
Airlines
ca
n't
get
financing
,
then
takeovers
in
general
must
be
headed
toward
extinction
.

The
market
,
already
chastened
by
a
number
of
leveraged
buy-outs
gone
bad
,
responded
in
a
flood
of
sell
orders
.

Yet
interviews
with
the
bankers

who
turned
down
the
UAL
proposal
suggest
the
market
may
have
misinterpreted
its
significance
.

The
buy-out
of
UAL
by
a
group
made
up
of
management
,
the
pilots
union
and
British
Airways
PLC
,
ran
into
difficulty
because
of
its
own
unique
problems
,
they
say
.

Banks
did
n't
suddenly
become
unwilling
to
finance
takeovers
,
they
just
did
n't
like
the
looks
of
this
particular
deal
.

Specifically
,
the
bankers
said
that
UAL
's
management
and
advisers
pushed
too
hard
,
trying
to
keep
too
much
of
the
potential
profit
for
themselves
.

The
airline
's
top
two
officers
,
chief
executive
Stephen
M.
Wolf
and
chief
financial
officer
John
C.
Pope
,
for
example
,
would
have
made
a
total
of
more
than
$
100
million
on
the
buy-out
through
stock
options
they
hold
,
even
though
their
proposal
called
for
them
to
put
only
$
15
million
of
their
own
funds
into
the
deal
.

Moreover
,
fees
and
interest
rates
paid
to
the
banks
would
have
been
stingy
--
far
below
those
in
comparable
takeovers
.

The
banks
also
said
they
were
worried
that
United
's
rosy
projections
of
future
income
--
and
therefore
its
ability
to
pay
off
the
debt
--
did
n't
adequately
take
into
account

the
bumpy
nature
of
the
airline
industry
.

From
a
lender
's
point
of
view
,
``
it
's
one
of
the
worst
big
takeover
proposals
we
've
seen
,
''
said
an
official
of
First
Chicago
Corp.
,
one
of
the
banks
asked
to
finance
the
buy-out
,
which
notably
did
n't
include
junk
bonds
.

Even
so
,
banks
such
as
First
Chicago
,
which
has
a
long
history
of
ties
to
UAL
,
stretched
their
lending
guidelines
as
far
as
possible
in
hopes
of
making
the
proposal
work
.

``
We
really
gave
this
thing
nine
looks
,
''
the
First
Chicago
officer
said
.

It
was
the
job
of
A.D.
Frazier
,
First
Chicago
's
commercial
lending
chief
,
to
call
the
buy-out
group
and
put
the
best
possible
face
on
the
news
.

``
We
called
them
back
and
said
if
they
needed
us
--
if
it
would
make
a
difference
--
we
'd
come
in
,
''
another
officer
familiar
with
the
matter
said
.

Of
course
,
it
was
n't
even
close
.

Other
U.S.
banks
and
,
more
importantly
,
those
in
Japan
,
also
said
no
.

In
the
end
,
the
proposal
never
got
far
beyond
the
original
financing
promises
made
by
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
,
which
together
had
agreed
to
commit
$
3
billion
and
said
they
were
``
highly
confident
''
they
could
raise
an
additional
$
4.2
billion
.

Representatives
and
advisers
to
the
buy-out
group
,
called
Airline
Acquisition
Corp.
,
met
throughout
the
weekend
in
an
effort
to
revise
their
$
300-a-share
offer
.

But
prospects
of
quickly
putting
together
a
new
deal
appeared
bleak
.

It
is
``
still
unclear
whether
this
can
be
easily
fixed
,
''
one
official
close
to
the
transaction
said
yesterday
afternoon
.

A
pilots
union
official
said
the
group
is
likely
to
wait
and
see
what

the
stock
market
does
Monday
before
making
any
decisions
.

``
We
've
got
a
lot
of
homework
to
do
,
a
lot
of
work
ahead
of
us
,
''
said
H.
Bruce
Bernstein
,
a
lawyer
at
Sidley
&
Austin
in
Chicago
,
which
is
representing
the
bank
group
.

Both

the
banks
'
decision
to
decline
financing
and
the
stock
market
's
reaction
caught
the
buy-out
group
off
guard
.

Friday
's
dominoes
began
falling
at
2:30
p.m.
,
when
the
stock
exchange
halted
trading
in
UAL
,
pending
news
.

The
news
came
at
2:54
.

Funds
committed
by
banks
for
the
buy-out
``
are
not
sufficient
,
''
the
acquisition
group
announced
.

UAL
was
trading
at
$
279.75
at
the
time
of
the
halt
and
never
reopened
for
trading
Friday
.

However
,
it
was
later
quoted
by
off-exchange
market
makers
at
as
low
as
$
230

a
share
.

At
3:30
,
with
the
market
now
in
a
free
fall
,
representatives
of
the
buy-out
group
scrambled
to
a
hastily
called
meeting
at
Citicorp
's
offices
at
399
Park
Avenue
in
New
York
.

The
group
was
trying
to
assess
what

it
would
take
to
resuscitate
the
deal
.

On
the
way
to
the
session
,
some
huddled
around
a
Quotron
machine

that
was
in
the
hallway
outside
the
meeting
room
.

``
The
Dow
's
going
down
,
down
,
down
,
''
said
one
observer
in
amazement
.

The
meeting

itself
,
held
in
the
corporate
finance
department
on
the
ninth
floor
,
was
disorganized
,
as
members
of
Citicorp
's
and
Chase
's
syndication
departments
called
other
banks
trying
to
figure
out
why
they
had
rejected
the
deal
.

At
3:55
,
five
minutes
before
the
market
closed
,
the
meeting
began
.

Gathered
around
a
long
table

that
filled
the
huge
conference
room
were
about
30
people
,
including
representatives
of
Citicorp
,
Chase
Manhattan
,
United
Airlines
,
British
Airways
,
Lazard
Freres
&
Co.
,
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
,
Skadden
Arps
(
Mr.
Wolf
's
counsel
)
and
Paul
Weiss
(
lawyer
for
the
pilots
union
)
.

One
person

who
was
n't
present
:
Mr.
Wolf
himself
who
,
confident
that
the
deal
would
go
through
,
was
returning
from
Europe
,
where
he
had
pitched
the
proposal
to
several
big
European
banks
.

``
People
were
surprised
,
shocked
and
upset
,
''
said
an
official
at
the
meeting
.

Mr.
Wolf
,
reached
at
his
Chicago
home
Saturday
,
declined
to
comment
.

As
they
met
to
review
what
had
gone
wrong
,
the
buy-out
group
quickly
discovered
that
one
of
the
big
roadblocks
had
been
Japanese
lenders
.

Although
they
had
provided
the
lion
's
share
of
the
financing
on
the
Northwest
Airlines
buy-out
just
a
few
months
before
,
Japanese
banks
had
said
no
to
UAL
.

The
Japanese
apparently
balked
at
several
aspects
of
the
proposal
.

A
senior
executive
at
one
of
Japan
's
biggest
banks
says
the
UAL
deal
``
was
stretched
.

It
's
a
cyclical
industry
,
and
all
the
projections
that
the
banks
are
working
off
are
straight
up
.

So
where
's
the
cycle
?

''

Japanese
lenders
also
recently
have
grown
more
conservative
toward
highly
leveraged
transactions
,
partly
because
of
the
recent
cash-squeeze
at
Canada
's
Campeau
Corp.
following
its
leveraged
purchase
of
Federated
Department
Stores
Inc.
last
year
.

Japanese
banks
are
worried
that
the
government
might
issue
restrictive
guidelines
unless
the
banks
hold
down
the
number
of
risky
leveraged-buy-out
loans
they
make
,
says
a
Japanese
monetary
official
.

``
So
,
they
are
very
cautious
,
''
he
says
.

A
third
problem
was
the
potential
for
labor
unrest
at
UAL
,
something

that
makes
the
Japanese
particularly
skittish
.

The
Japanese
banks
were
reminded
of
the
labor
tensions
at
UAL

all
last
week
.

On
Wednesday
,
the
machinists
union
asked
the
U.S.
Labor
Department
to
step
in
to
stop
the
buy-out
.

On
Thursday
,
at
their
national
convention
in
Las
Vegas
,
machinists
union
leaders
discussed
launching
an
allout
campaign
against
UAL
Chairman
Wolf
specifically
.

The
machinists
have
opposed
the
buy-out
because
they
were
n't
invited
to
participate
in
the
deal
and
because
they
fear
all
the
debt

that
would
be
taken
on
in
the
transaction
would
overburden
the
company
.

Machinists
union
leader
John
Peterpaul
also
made
the
union
's
views
known
in
telephone
conversations
with
representatives
of
Mitsubishi
Bank
,
one
of
the
Japanese
banks

that
was
considering
participating
in
the
financing
.

In
those
conversations
,
he
reiterated
the
union
's
position
that
it
would
seek
significant
wage
increases
in
the
round
of
contract
talks
set
to
begin
next
month
.

The
Japanese
banks
,
however
,
were
n't
the
only
ones
worried
.

At
First
Chicago
,
executives
were
sharply
divided
on
whether
the
bank
should
participate
--
and
what
consequences

there
would
be
if
it
rejected
its
longtime
client
.

Among
other
things
,
the
bank
feared
``
we
'd
look
like
dogs
''
if
United
was
able
to
piece
together
the
financing
and
First
Chicago
was
absent
,
a
top
lending
officer
said
.

United
's
Mr.
Pope
was
warning
that
just
that
could
happen
.

``
Pope
told
us

there
's
no
question

the
banks
are
going
to
sign
up
.

''

As
the
Thursday
afternoon
deadline
for
banks
neared
,
some

lending
officers
at
First
Chicago
remained
in
favor
of
joining
the
financing
group
,
but
the
bank
's
``
credit
police
''
were
opposed
,
citing
the
high
degree
of
risk
associated
with
the
loan
.

A
vote
of
top
officers
,
including
Chairman
Barry
F.
Sullivan
,
Thursday
morning
was
strongly
against
the
loan
.

One
official
close
to
the
transaction
said
banks
were
worried
about
the
amount
of
assets

the
buy-out
group
had
to
cover
the
loans
.

He
said
in
the
NWA
Inc.
acquisition
,
banks
were
secured
with
well
over
$
1
in
assets
for
every
$
1
of
loan
exposure
.

In
the
UAL
transaction
,
however
,
a
banker
's
loans
would
have
been
secured
with
less
than
$
1
in
assets
for
every
dollar
of
loans
.

Another
problem
:
The
buy-out
group
's
financial
projections
did
n't
assume
any
type
of
recession
in
the
near
future
.

For
instance
,
the
group
projected
that
revenue
would
increase
nearly
10
%
annually
over
the
next
few
years
.

It
estimated
that
yields
--
the
amount
of
income

the
airline
takes
in
on
ticket
sales
--
would
increase
an
average
of
3.5
%

a
year
,
despite
the
ups
and
downs
the
industry
has
suffered
in
the
last
10
years
.

The
projections
also
assumed
that
load
factors
--
the
number
of
seats
filled
per
aircraft
--
would
remain
a
stable
66.7
%
or
thereabouts
,
even
though
domestic
travel
has
been
weakening
.

According
to
a
machinists
union
analysis
of
the
transaction

that
will
be
presented
to
the
Department
of
Transportation
and
a
House
Aviation
subcommittee
later
this
week
,
a
``
mild
recession
''
would
result
in
the
company
's
taking
in
$
3.5
billion
less
cash
in
the
next
four
years
than
forecast
by
the
buy-out
group
.

Clearly
,
any
new
bid
will
have
to
include
more
profit
for
lenders
and
that
probably
means
less
cash
for
UAL
shareholders
,
including
the
heavily
stock-optioned
Messrs.
Wolf
and
Pope
.

Citicorp
,
the
lead
bank
on
the
financing
proposal
,
meanwhile
,
has
a
resounding
flop
on
its
hands
.

It
agreed
to
put
up
$
2
billion

itself
,
while
co-lead
Chase
Manhattan
agreed
to
provide
$
1
billion
.

The
two
New
York
banks
have
already
been
paid
combined
fees
of
$
8
million
for
the
commitments
.

Citicorp
and
Chase
told
the
buy-out
group

they
were
``
highly
confident
''
they
could
raise
the
remaining
$
4.2
billion
needed
to
finance
the
deal
.

(
The
$
7.2
billion

the
banks
said
they
needed
includes
some
refinancing
of
existing
debt
,
and
is
therefore
greater
than
the
$
6.79
billion
offered
for
UAL
.

)
Citibank
's
confidence
was
bolstered
as
recently
as
10
days
ago
when
representatives
of
120
banks

that
had
expressed
interest
in
the
UAL
transaction
attended
a
meeting
with
Citibank
representatives
.

``
Ninety
percent
of
the
questions
asked
were
friendly
,
''
said
a
person

who
attended
.

``
There
were
a
lot
of
indications

both
before
and
after
that
this
was
a
deal
people
thought
well
of
.

''

But
Citibank
's
confidence
may
also
have
bordered
on
arrogance
,
other
bankers
contend
.

The
recent
buy-out
financing
of
NWA
,
Northwest
Airlines
'
parent
,
for
instance
,
was
a
much

more
collaborative
effort
among
several
U.S.
banks
.

It
was
a
far
safer
deal
for
lenders
,
since
NWA
had
a
healthier
cash
flow
and
more
collateral
on
hand
.

And
banks
'
fees
were
much
higher
as
well
.

No
wonder
,
then
,
that
lenders
lined
up
to
participate
.

``
Perhaps
lenders
are
finally
recognizing
that
the
stream
of
airline
cash
flow
may
be
less
predictable
and
a
higher
risk
than
previously
considered
,
''
said
Karen
Firestone
,
a
money
manager
at
Fidelity
Investments
in
Boston
.

Ms.
Firestone
added
,
``
In
the
same
week

that
USAir
announces
they
might
lose
money
in
the
quarter
,
United
is
trying
to
get
money
for
a
$
300-a-share
buy-out
.

It

's
kind
of
like
,
what
's
wrong
with
this
picture
?

''

According
to
bankers
and
others
familiar
with
the
financing
proposal
,
several
things
need
to
be
fixed
:

Fees
paid
to
the
banks
,
set
at
about
1.5
%
of
loans
,
are
low
compared
with
other
buy-outs
,
which
have
paid
2
%
to
2.5
%
.

Because
buy-out
loans
often
get
refinanced
--
and
thus
paid
off
--
ahead
of
schedule
,
banks
ca
n't
count
on
years
of
interest
income
from
these
loans
.

They
like
deals
to
be
``
front-loaded
''
with
fees
.

What
's
more
,
fees
in
the
UAL
proposal
were
n't
structured
to
encourage
banks
to
commit
to
lending
large
amounts
of
money
.

The
interest
rate
promised
the
banks
was
also
relatively
low
;
2
%
over
the
rate
banks
charge
each
other
in
London
,
known
as
LIBOR
.

And
bankers
were
concerned
that
there
were
n't
any
junk
bondholders
or
other
buyers
of
subordinated
debt
standing
between
potential
losses
and
the
banks
'
senior
loans
.

``
Most
of
these
leveraged
deals
have
been
done
with
a
pretty
heavy
layer
of
junk
,
''
a
First
Chicago
executive
said
.

``
This

one
has
zippo
.

''

Because
the
junk
bond
market
has
ground
to
a
halt
since
Campeau
's
problems
were
made
manifest
,
so-called
bridge
loans
from
Wall
Street
firms
or
other
sources
could
be
used
for
subordinated
debt
in
the
UAL
deal
.

In
the
meantime
,
though
,
airline
executives
,
union
officials
,
lawyers
,
investment
bankers
and
even
the
machinists
will
have
one
eye
on
United
and
one
eye
on
the
stock
market

they
helped
to
tank
.

Says
an
official
working
on
the
buy-out
:
``
As
time
goes
by
,
you
have
to
get
more
worried
.

In
a
possible
prelude
to
the
resumption
of
talks
between
Boeing
Co.
and
striking
Machinists
union
members
,
a
federal
mediator
said
representatives
of
the
two
sides
will
meet
with
him

tomorrow
.

``
It
could
be
a
long
meeting
or
it
could
be
a
short
one
,
''
said
Doug
Hammond
,
the
mediator
,
who
called
the
agreement
to
meet
a
first
step
toward
a
resumption
of
negotiations
.

``
We
're
encouraged
that
talks
are
scheduled
again
but
beyond
that
,
we
have
made
no
expression
of
expectations
,
''
a
Boeing
spokesman
said
.

The
Machinists
union
has
rejected
a
three-year
contract
offer

that
would
have
provided
a
10
%
wage
increase
over
the
life
of
the
pact
,
plus
some
bonuses
.

Currently
,
average
pay
for
machinists
is
$
13.39

an
hour
,
Boeing
said
.

Now
in
its
13th
day
,
the
strike
has
idled
about
55,000
machinists
and
has
started
to
delay
delivery
of
some
jetliners
.

With
a
strike
fund
of
about
$
100
million
,
the
union
had
said
it
was
prepared
for
a
long
strike
.

After
the
third
week
on
strike
,
union
members
will
begin
receiving
$
100

a
week
from
the
fund
.

Work
at
Boeing
continues
with
supervisors
and
other
non-striking
personnel
manning
the
lines
.

And
at
the
company
's
Wichita
,
Kan.
,
plant
,
about
2,400
of
the
11,700
machinists
still
are
working
,
Boeing
said
.

Under
Kansas
right-to-work
laws
,
contracts
can
not
require
workers
to
be
union
members
.

Boeing
has
declined
to
say
how
many
employees
are
working
at
its
giant
Renton
,
Wash.
,
plant
.

Tokyo
share
prices
rebounded
Tuesday
morning
,
with
the
Nikkei
index
of
225
selected
stocks
rising
618.69
points
to
close
the
morning
session
at
35087.38
.

The
index
slid
647.33
points
,
or
1.8
%
,
on
Monday
.

In
the
first
25
minutes
of
Tuesday
's
trading
the
Nikkei
index
soared
664.83
points
,
to
35133.83
.

By
10
a.m.

Tokyo
time
,
the
index
was
up
435.11
points
,
to
34903.80
as
investors
hailed
New
York
's
overnight
rally
.

Monday
's
slide
came
in
a
relatively
calm
session

that
did
n't
provide
much
direction
for
other
markets
.

Shares
also
closed
sharply
lower
across
Europe
,
particularly
in
Frankfurt
,
although
London
and
a
few
other
markets
recovered
some
ground
after
stocks
began
to
rebound
in
New
York
.

Other
Asian
and
Pacific
markets
had
sharper
losses
than
Tokyo
,
but
the
selling
wave
stopped
short
of
precipitating
another
market
crash
.

All
eyes
were
on
Tokyo
at
the
opening
because
it
was
the
first
major
market
to
trade
since
Friday
's
190.58-point
plunge
on
Wall
Street
.

But
rather
than
set
the
tone
for
other
markets
,
Japan
's
major
institutional
investors
chose
to
remain
on
the
sidelines
.

Still
,
despite
the
sudden
reappearance
of
stock-market
turbulence
,
managers
of
Japanese
investment
funds
said
they
were
n't
planning
to
unload
U.S.
or
European
equities
.

``
We
did
n't
trade
much
today
,
as
our
policy
now
is
to
wait
and
see
,
''
said
a
fund
manager
at
Taisho
Life
Insurance
Co
.

``
We
would
like
to
wait
and
see
until
trading
goes
around
through
Europe
and
New
York
.

''

The
institutions
appeared
confident
that
Japanese
regulators
would
step
in
to
ensure
orderly
trading
if
necessary
,
and
there
was
considerable
speculation
during
the
day
that
the
Finance
Ministry
was
working
behind
the
scenes
to
do
just
that
.

But
in
the
absence
of
panicky
trading
,
its
presence
was
never
overtly
felt
.

At
the
close
,
the
Nikkei
average
of
225
stocks
stood
at
34468.69
,
down
647.33
points
,
or
1.8
%
.

The
broader
Tokyo
Stock
Price
Index
sank
45.66
,
or
1.7
%
,
to
2600.88
.

The
day
's
decline
was
generally
in
line
with
analysts
'
weekend
predictions
.

Declining
issues
swamped
advancers
,
941-105
.

But
volume
was
thin
at
526.2
million
shares
,
compared
with
574.7
million
Friday
.

The
market
opened
sharply
lower
,
with
the
Nikkei
average
down
nearly
600
after
20
minutes
.

A
midmorning
rebound
brought
it
back
to
show
a
gain
of
about
200
at
the
end
of
the
morning
session
,
but
the
rally
failed
in
the
afternoon
,
and
the
market
closed
near
the
day
's
low
.

The
smaller
stocks
in
the
Tokyo
market
's
second
section
also
posted
their
biggest
decline
of
the
year
.

The
Tokyo
Stock
Exchange
index
for
the
second
section
fell
100.96
,
or
2.7
%
,
to
3655.40
.

Many
investors
,
trying
to
outperform
the
market
's
major
indexes
,
have
flocked
to
these
small
issues
in
recent
weeks
.

Japanese
investors
and
traders
expressed
relief
that
the
Tokyo
market
did
n't
fall
more
sharply
.

But
its
performance
did
bear
some
resemblance
to
events
of
two
years
ago
,
during
the
October
1987
global
stock
market
crash
.

On
Oct.
16
,
1987
--
the
Friday
before
the
Black
Monday
crash
--
the
New
York
market
dropped
4.6
%
,
and
Tokyo
followed
on
Monday
with
a
2.4
%
drop
.

This
time
,
Wall
Street
's
plunge
of
6.9
%
Friday
was
followed
by
yesterday
's
1.8
%
loss
in
Tokyo
.

Two
years
ago
,
Tokyo
's
biggest
fall
came
the
day
after
New
York
's
22.6
%
Black
Monday
plunge
,
when
the
Nikkei
average
fell
14.9
%
.

Thus
,
market
participants
yesterday
were
looking
ahead
nervously
to
Wall
Street
's
opening
.

But
in
New
York
yesterday
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
surged
88.12
to
close
at
2657.38
on
heavy
volume
of
416,290,000
shares
,
although
declining
issues
still
outnumbered
advancing
ones
on
the
broad
market
.

Nobuto
Yasuda
,
a
director
at
Yamaichi
Investment
Trust
&
Management
Co.
,
called
yesterday
's
session
``
a
good
scenario
''
for
Japan
.

``
Now
we
are
looking
for
the
time
to
place
buy
orders
,
''
he
said
.

``
For
us
institutional
investors
,
the
chance
for
buying
has
come
.

''

Isao
Ushikubo
,
general
manager
of
the
investment
research
department
at
Toyo
Trust
&
Banking
Co.
,
also
was
optimistic
.

He
described
Friday
's
plunge
in
the
U.S.
as
a
``
fleeting
''
event
resulting
in
part
from
excessive
merger
and
acquisition
activity
.

``
Unless
there
is
a
panic
,
this
is
the
best
time
to
buy
,
as
was
the
case
two
years
ago
,
''
he
said
.

``
Those
shares

which
had
posted
gains
on
M&A
speculation
were
dashed
with
cold
water
,
but
as
far
as
major
stocks
are
concerned
,
there
is
n't
much
impact
.

''

Other
fund
managers
were
similarly
sanguine
.

``
We
have
no
plans
to
adjust
our
asset
allocation
in
foreign
equities
,
''
said
Masato
Murakami
,
chief
portfolio
manager
in
the
pension
fund
management
department
at
Yasuda
Trust
&
Banking
Co
.

He
said
Friday
's
Wall
Street
decline
was
``
well
within
the
range
of
volatility
''
that
Yasuda
Trust
plans
for
when
it
charts
its
overseas
investment
strategy
.

Among
other
Asian
and
Pacific
markets
,
Malaysia
and
Singapore
had
the
biggest
losses
,
with
the
Kuala
Lumpur
composite
index
in
Malaysia
falling
11.5
%
and
Singapore
's
Straits
Times
Industrial
Index
down
10
%
.

Major
indexes
declined
more
than
8
%
in
Australia
and
New
Zealand
and
6.5
%
in
Hong
Kong
.

Bangkok
,
Manila
,
Seoul
,
Taipei
and
Jakarta
escaped
with
slightly
smaller
losses
.

Brokers
and
fund
managers
said
the
region
's
markets
were
reacting
to
Friday
's
Wall
Street
plunge
even
though
that
decline
was
due
to
local
factors
such
as
failed
corporate
buy-outs
and
a
deteriorating
junk-bond
market
.

``
It
's
pure
psychology
,
''
said
William
Au
Yeung
,
an
account
executive
for
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
(
HK
)
Ltd.
in
Hong
Kong
.

``
Markets
in
this
region
are
n't
so
geared
to
leveraged
buy-outs
,
and
their
economies
generally
are
in
good
shape
,
but
there
's
no
doubt

that
Asia
is
still
following
America
's
lead
.

''

Several
analysts
said
Malaysia
and
Singapore
had
the
biggest
losses
because
they
are
relatively
open
to
rapid
cash
flows
.

Hong
Kong
is
the
region
's
next
most
open
market
,
but
many
foreign
investors
have
been
staying
away
from
it
since
it
plunged
in
June
amid
political
turmoil
in
China
.

``
Singapore
took
the
hit
because
when
people
want
to
get
out
,
they
tend
to
go
where
the
liquidity
is
,
''
said
Elizabeth
Hambrecht
,
a
regional
analyst
with
Baring
Securities
(
Hong
Kong
)
Ltd
.

She
pointed
out
that
even
after
Monday
's
10
%
decline
,
the
Straits
Times
index
is
up
24
%

this
year
,
so
investors

who
bailed
out
generally
did
so
profitably
.

Similarly
,
Kuala
Lumpur
's
composite
index
yesterday
ended
27.5
%
above
its
1988
close
.

In
Hong
Kong
,
the
Hang
Seng
Index
fell
180.60
to
finish
at
2601.70
.

Trading
was
heavy
at
about
one
billion
shares
,
compared
with
473.9
million
Friday
.

But
the
session
was
orderly
,
in
contrast
to
the
market
's
four-day
closure
after
the
1987
crash
.

Richard
Chenevix-Trench
,
a
director
at
Hong
Kong-based
Baring
International
Fund
Managers
Ltd.
,
said
the
market
probably
has
n't
hit
bottom
yet
but
is
close
.

``
If
New
York
does
n't
collapse
,
I
see
maybe
another
5
%
on
the
downside
,
not
counting
the
risk
of
bad
news
out
of
China
,
''
he
said
.

In
Australia
,
Sydney
's
All
Ordinaries
index
closed
at
1601.5
,
down
8.1
%
,
its
biggest
drop
since
October
1987
.

But
volume
rose
only
to
162
million
shares
from
143
million
Friday
.

Nestor
Hinzack
,
an
analyst
at
brokerage
firm
Burdett
,
Buckeridge
&
Young
Ltd.
,
described
the
market
's
performance
as
``
sheep-like
''
as
investors
fled
to
bluechip
Australian
stocks
and
shunned
entrepreneurial
companies
they
perceived
as
having
any
takeover
premium
built
into
the
price
.

London
's
Financial
Times-Stock
Exchange
100-share
index
,
the
most
closely
watched
market
barometer
,
ended
at
its
intraday
high
of
2163.4
,
down
70.5
,
or
3.2
%
.

At
its
low
,
shortly
before
Wall
Street
opened
,
it
was
off
more
than
130
points
.

The
Financial
Times
30-share
index
closed
79.3
points
lower
at
1738.7
.

Volume
more
than

Prices
on

The

in
the
German
Stock
Index
of
203.56
points
,
or
12.8

,
to
1385.72
was
the
Frankfurt
market
's
steepest
fall
ever
.

Retail
investors
dumped
holdings
on
a
massive
scale
,
pushing
some
blue-chip
shares
down
as
much
as
20
%
.

Analysts
cited
memories
of
two
years
ago
,
when
many
small
investors
held
on
to
their
shares
after
the
October
crash
but
the
West

market
continued
to
decline
steeply

Environmental
Systems
Co.
said
it
is
restating
its
results
to
reduce
its
reported
net
income
for
the
first
nine
months
of
its
fiscal
year
after
discovering
it
took
tax
credits

that
already
had
been
taken
last
year
.

The
Little
Rock
,
Ark.
,
hazardous-waste
services
company
said
the
restatement
will
reduce
its
net
for
the
nine
months
ended
July
31
to
$
2.5
million
,
or
17
cents

a
share
,
from
$
3.7
million
,
or
26
cents

a
share
.

Net
for
the
third
quarter
,
restated
,
is
$
1.6
million
,
or
10
cents

a
share
.

The
company
previously
reported
net
of
$
2.3
million
,
or
15
cents

a
share
.

The
company
said
that
for
financial
reporting
purposes
last
year

it
took
tax
credits

that
will
be
recognized
for
tax
purposes

this
year
.

But
because
of
confusion
,
it
took
those
credits
again
in
reporting
its
results
through
the
first
nine
months
.

Jack
W.
Forrest
,
Environmental
Systems
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
said
the
change
increases
the
company
's
effective
tax
rate
to
about
35
%
from
20
%
.

Take

Liquidating

the
Irvine
,
Calif.
,
thrift
will
drain
the
federal
deposit
insurance
fund
by
more
than
$
2.5
billion
,
making
it

the
largest
thrift
failure
in
history
.

Now
,
finally
,
there
may
be
an
investigation
to
explore
how
five
senatorial
shills
helped
perpetuate
this
fiscal
black
hole
.

Back
in
June
,
we
recounted
how
five
U.S.
Senators
--
Alan
Cranston
of
California
,
Dennis
DeConcini
and
John
McCain
of
Arizona
,
John
Glenn
of
Ohio
and
Donald
Riegle
of
Michigan
--
intervened
with
regulators
to
ease
up
on
Lincoln
,
whose
risk-fraught
loans
were
more
worthy
of
a
casino
than
a
federally
insured
thrift
.

Last
Friday
,
Common
Cause
,
a
political-reform
lobby
,
asked
for
a
Senate
Ethics
Committee
probe
of
the
five
Senators
.

It
wants
both

an
outside
counsel
to
conduct
the
probe
and
a
parallel
Justice
Department
investigation
,
things

it
has
not
initially
asked
for
in
previous
ethics
cases
.

Perhaps
Common
Cause
has
come
to
recognize
that
Congress
is
generally
incapable
of
investigating
itself
.

Charles
Keating
Jr.
,
the
chairman
of
American
Continental
,
Lincoln
's
parent
company
,
needed
the
Senators
'
help
in
his
running
battle
with
federal
regulators
.

He
admits
he
made
large
contributions
to
each
of
them
so
they
would
``
take
up
my
cause
.

''
In
one
case
,
57
Keating
executives
gave
$
66,100
to
Senator
Riegle
at
the
same
March
1987
fund-raiser
.

Mr.
Riegle
later
returned
the
money
.

In
April
1987
,
the
Senators
,
,
absent
Mr.
Riegle
,
asked
to
meet
with
Ed
Gray
,
then
head
of
the
Federal
Home
Loan
Bank
Board
,
and
according
to
Mr.
Gray
,
unsuccessfully
pressed
him
to
drop
a
key
regulation
detrimental
to
Lincoln
--
``
a
clear
subversion
of
the
regulatory
process
.

''
Senator
McCain
now
calls
the
meeting
``
improper
''
and
after
several
previous
denials
,
Senator
Cranston
now
admits
the
regulation
probably
came
up
.

Days
later
,
the
four
senators
--
joined
by
Mr.
Riegle
--
met
with
other
regulators
to
press
Lincoln
's
case
.

Senators
Glenn
,
Riegle
and
McCain
apparently
stopped
doing
favors
for
Mr.
Keating
after
that
,
but
Senators
Cranston
and
DeConcini
persisted
,
intervening
on
behalf
of
Lincoln
until
just
before
its
closure

this
year
.

It
now
turns
out
that
at
least
four
of
the
five
Senators
may
have
been
indebted
to
Mr.
Keating
far
beyond
mere
campaign
contributions
:

--
The
Arizona
Republic
reports
that
two
of
Senator
DeConcini
's
top
aides
received
more
than
$
50
million
in
real-estate
loans
from
Lincoln
.

--
Senator
McCain
recently
reimbursed
Mr.
Keating
for
$
13,400
in
previously
unreported
airplane
trips
,
and
revealed
that
his
wife
and
father-in-law
invested
$
359,100
in
a
Keating
shopping-center
partnership
in
1986
.

--
Senator
Cranston
solicited
$
850,000
in
contributions
from
Mr.
Keating
for
three
``
nonpartisan
''
voter-registration
groups
,
which
some
former
employees
now
say
were
fronts
for
the
Democratic
Party
.

--
Senator
Glenn
solicited
$
200,000
in
contributions
from
Mr.
Keating
for
a
political
committee

he
controlled
that
paid
him
to
travel
around
the
country
.

Some
$
43,000
was
used
for
the
Glenn
Senate
campaign
--
a
possible
violation
of
federal
election
law
.

The
lack
of
attention
to
the
Keating
drama
is
astonishing
in
light
of
the
magnitude
of
the
savings-and-loan
disaster
.

The
S&L
bailout
promises
to
cost
the
taxpayers

some
$
200
billion
,
with
Lincoln
accounting
for
$
2.5
billion
alone
.

By
contrast
,
the
extensively
covered
HUD
political
scandals
may
cost
the
taxpayers
$
2.0
billion
,
the
centerpiece
being
a
$
0.0003
billion
check
to
James
Watt
,
the
legality
of
which
seems
to
be
uncontested
.

Similarly
,
the
spate
of
dubious
prosecutions
in
finance
obscures
the
seriousness
of
the
allegations
against
Mr.
Keating
and
his
associates
.

This
is
not
a
matter
of
whispering
``
bunny
.

''
The
160-page
civil
suit
filed
against
Mr.
Keating
last
month
by
the
Resolution
Trust
Corp.
,
the
vehicle
for
the
S&L
bailout
,
traces
a
clear
thread
.

Money
was
taken
into
Lincoln
,
for
example
by
selling
$
250
million
in
uninsured
debentures
near
retirement
communities
,
and
allegedly
taken
out
of
the
parent
company
by
insiders
,
for
example
by
the
sale
of
their
personal
stock
to
the
company
's
employee
stock
ownership
plan
.

The
case
remains
to
be
tested
in
court
,
of
course
,
but
if
the
allegations
hold
up
the
Senators
were
defending
a
classic
scam
.

Common
Cause
is
n't
the
only
body

that
thinks
the
Keating
Five
's
interventions
deserve
scrutiny
.

The
House
Banking
Committee
has
voted
to
subpoena
Mr.
Keating
and
top
federal
regulators
to
testify
about
Lincoln
.

The
hearings
begin
tomorrow
,
and
will
focus
on
why
thrift
regulator
M.
Danny
Wall
,
a
former
Senate
staffer
,
overruled
staff
recommendations
to
close
Lincoln
and
transferred
regulatory
oversight
of
Lincoln
to
Washington
.

Between
April
,
1987
,
when
the
five
senators
intervened
,
and
April
,
1988
,
when
Lincoln
was
finally
closed
,
the
losses
to
taxpayers
grew
by
some
$
1.5
billion
.

It
was
Common
Cause
's
demand
last
year
for
a
House
Ethics
Committee
probe
of
Speaker
Jim
Wright

that
prompted
the
committee
to
hire
Richard
Phelan
as
an
outside
counsel
.

Mr.
Phelan
found
that
Mr.
Wright
had
improperly
intervened
with
federal
regulators
on
behalf
of
S&Ls
,
but
the
Ethics
Committee
disagreed
,
saying
such
actions
were
an
integral
part
of
a
Member
's
job
and
it
could
not
second-guess
``
the
technique
and
personality
of
the
legislator
.

''
If
the
Senate
Ethics
Committee
chooses
to
investigate
,
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
if
it
reaches
the
same
conclusion
in
the
case
of
the
five
Senators
.

Memotec
Data
Inc.
said
it
signed
a
definitive
merger
agreement
with
ISI
Systems
Inc.
under
which

Memotec
will
acquire
ISI
for
$
20
(
U.S
.

)
a
share
,
or
about
$
130
million
,
in
cash
and
securities
.

In
American
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
,
ISI
closed
up
$
3.125
at
$
18.625
.

In
Montreal
Exchange
trading
,
Memotec
closed
unchanged
at
10.625
Canadian
dollars
(
US$
9.05
)
.

Memotec
said
under
the
agreement
,
ISI
,
a
Braintree
,
Mass.
,
provider
of
computer
software
and
services
to
the
insurance
industry
,
will
merge
with
a
U.S.
unit
of
Memotec
created
for
that
purpose
.

Memotec
is
a
Montreal-based
maker
of
telecommunications
products
and
provider
of
telecommunications
and
computer
services
.

Memotec
said
the
agreement
calls
for
it
to
make
a
$
20-a-share
cash
tender
offer
for
all
shares
outstanding
of
ISI
.

But
it
said
Charles
Johnston
,
ISI
chairman
and
president
,
agreed
to
sell
his
60
%
stake
in
ISI
to
Memotec
upon
completion
of
the
tender
offer
for
a
combination
of
cash
,
Memotec
stock
and
debentures
.

Memotec
said
the
tender
offer
is
conditioned
on
,
among
other
things
,
holders
tendering
at
least
15
%
of
the
shares
outstanding
,
other
than
the
shares
held
by
Mr.
Johnston
.

ISI
said
its
board
has
instructed
management
to
accept
inquiries
from
any
others
interested
in
making
a
bid
.

ISI
said
it
can
withdraw
from
the
merger
agreement
with
Memotec
if
a
better
bid
surfaces
.

Moody

subordinated

CENTRUST
SAVINGS
BANK
(
Miami
)
--
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc.
downgraded
its
ratings
on
the
subordinated
debt
of
CenTrust
to
Caa
from
B-3
.

The
rating
agency
also
reduced
the
ratings
for
long-term
deposits
to
B-3
from
Ba-3
and
for
preferred
stock
to
Ca
from
Caa
.

The
rating
agency
said
about
$
85
million
in
securities
was
affected
.

The
downgrades
were
prompted
,
Moody
's
said
,
by
the
continuing
turmoil
in
the
junk
bond
market
and
the
suspension
of
dividends
on
CenTrust
's
preferred
stock
.

Moody
's
also
said
it
believed
the
proposed
sale
of
63
CenTrust
branches
to
Great
Western
Bank
could
,
if
completed
,
endanger
the
thrift
's
funding

market
position

Whirlpool
Corp.
,
Benton
Harbor
,
Mich.
,
said
it
has
developed
a
process
to
recover
environmentally
harmful
chlorofluorocarbons
,
or
CFCs
,
that
previously
entered
the
atmosphere
during
in-home
repair
of
refrigerators
and
freezers
.

The
maker
of
home
appliances
said
the
process
,
which
involves
the
use
of
a
multilayer
plastic
bag
during
repairs
to
capture
the
gaseous
substance
and
transport

it
to
a
recycling
center
,
is
already
in
use
at
a
number
of
its
service
centers
,
and
will
be
available
to
all
authorized
repair
centers
by
spring
.

Earlier
repairs
vented
the
CFCs
out
of
the
home
through
a
hose
directly
into
the
atmosphere
.

CFCs
are
widely
used
as
solvents
,
coolants
and
fire
suppressants
.

But
their
use
has
been
linked
to
a
potentially
dangerous
depletion
of
the
Earth
's
ozone
layer
,
and
a
number
of
companies
are
seeking
to
curtail
use
,
or
at
least
emission
,
of
the
substance
.

Whirpool
said
,
``
We
see
this
process
as
a
small
but
important
step
toward
eventual
elimination
of
CFC
use
in
appliance
manufacture

Waterford
Wedgwood
PLC
,
a
financially
troubled
Irish
maker
of
fine
crystal
and
Wedgwood
china
,
reported
that
its
pretax
loss
for
the
first
six
months
widened
to
10.6
million
Irish
punts
(
$
14.9
million
)
from
5.8
million
Irish
punts

a
year
earlier
.

The
results
for
the
half
were
worse
than
market
expectations
,
which
suggested
an
interim
loss
of
around
10
million
Irish
punts
.

In
a
sharply
weaker
London
market
yesterday
,
Waterford
shares
were
down
15
pence
at
50
pence
(
79
cents
)
.

The
company
reported
a
loss
after
taxation
and
minority
interests
of
14
million
Irish
punts
,
compared
with
a
loss
of
9.3
million
Irish
punts

year-earlier
period
.

There
were

Waterford
said
the

agreement

Dallas
investor
Harold
Simmons
says
he

has
n't
decided
to
sell
his
Lockheed
Corp.
shares
,
after
all
.

In
a
terse
news
release
responding
to
an
article
yesterday
in
The
Wall
Street
Journal
,
which
credited
a
front-page
interview
story
in

Sunday
Los

Daily

Valhi

said
the
quotes
in
the
articles
``
do
not
accurately
reflect
Valhi
's
and
Mr.
Simmons
's
intentions
''
concerning
their
interests
in
Lockheed
.

Through
Valhi
and
its
affiliates
,
Mr.
Simmons
holds
a
10.43
%
stake
in
the
aerospace
and
electronics
concern
,
and
his
plans
concerning
Lockheed
have
been
the
subject
of
much
speculation
among
securities
analysts
.

In
the
Daily

story
,
Mr.
Simmons
was
quoted
as
saying
,
among
other
things
:
``
Actually
,
I
wish
I
were
out
of
Lockheed

The
defense
industry
seems
to
be
getting
more
uncertain
all
the
time

I
'm
a
seller

Put
it
in
big
black
letters

underline
it

''

Yesterday
's
statement
by
Valhi

the

``

paraphrase

''
The
true
position
is
that
Valhi
and
its

,
as
they
have
said
in
public
filings
,
``
may
increase
,
decrease

retain
their

10
%
drop
in
third-quarter
net
income
,
citing
intense
competition

that
caused
its
gross
profit
margins
to
dip
.

Net
income
for
the
quarter
fell
to
$
93.1
million
from
$
103.1
million
,
roughly
what
analysts
had
expected
.

But
per-share
profit
dropped
only
2
%
to
$
1.23

a
share
from
$
1.26

a
share
,
as
the
company
continued
its
stock
buy-back
plan
.

Average
shares
outstanding
dropped
to
75.8
million
from
82.1
million
.

Revenue
fell
1
%
to
$
1.39
billion
from
$
1.41
billion
.

The
computer
maker
,
which
sells
more
than
half
its
goods
outside
the
U.S.
,
also
said
the
negative
effect
of
a
stronger
U.S.
dollar
will
``
adversely
affect
''
its
fourth-quarter
performance
and
``
make
it
difficult
''
to
better
1988
results
.

NCR
said
revenue
declined
both
in
the
U.S.
and
overseas
,
reflecting
a
world-wide
softening
of
the
computer
markets
.

The
company
,
however
,
said
orders
in
the
U.S.
showed
``
good
gains
''
during
the
latest
quarter
.

Analysts
estimate
those
gains
at
12
%
to
13
%
,
a
good
part
of
it
coming
from
large
orders
placed
by
a
few
of
NCR
's
major
customers
.

In
addition
to
a
general
slowing
of
the
computer
industry
,
NCR
,
which
sells
automated
teller
machines
and
computerized
cash
registers
,
is
also
affected
by
the
retail
and
financial
sectors
,
``
areas
of
the
economy

that
have
generally
not
been
robust
,
''
notes
Sanjiv
G.
Hingorani
,
an
analyst
for
Salomon
Brothers
Inc
.

These
factors
,
combined
with
a
strong
dollar
,
should
negatively
affect
the
current
quarter
's
results
,
NCR
said
.

In
the
year-earlier
fourth
quarter
,
NCR
had
profit
of
$
149.6
million
,
or
$
1.85

a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
1.8
billion
.

Mr.
Hingorani
said
he
lowered
his
full-year
estimates
for
1989
to
$
5.35

a
share
from
$
5.50

a
share
.

Revenue
projections
were
slashed
to
$
6.03
billion
from
$
6.20
billion
.

Last
year
,
NCR
had
net
income
of
$
439.3
million
,
or
$
5.33

a
share
,
on
$
5.99
billion
in
revenue
.

For
the
nine
months
,
the
company
's
earnings
fell
9
%
to
$
264.6
million
,
or
$
3.40

a

,
from
$
289.7

a

field
northeast
of
its
previously
discovered

on
the
three
discovery
wells
it
drilled
in
the
field
,
which
is
about
1.6
miles
from
the
Intan
Field
,
because
the
wells
are
similar
to
others
drilled
at
its
Intan
and
Widuri
fields
.

However
,
Maxus
said
it
believes
the
reserves
in
the
field
are
about
10
million
barrels
of
oil
.

The
Intan
Field
has
estimated
reserves
of
50

for
the
third

,
contrary
to
reported
analysts
'
comments
that
the

A

said
he
believed
the

was
caused
when
James

,
Knight-Ridder

two

that
Knight-Ridder

said
the
third-quarter
earnings
that
the

plans

to
be
up
.

The
spokesman
said
he
was
``
comfortable
''
with
revised
analysts
'
projections
that
the
company
would
report
earnings
of
between
62
cents
and
64
cents

a
share
,
compared
with
the
53
cents

a
share

it
reported
for
the

third
quarter
.

Knight-Ridder
said
it
agreed
with
estimates
that
net
income
for
all
of

would
be
around

Concerning

``

I
'm
delighted
that
Wall

is
finally
tuning
in
to
the
hard
,
cold
facts
of
the

working
world

If

why
limit

the

to
the
poor

maligned

whose
ability
to
see
into

fragile

best
?

Why
not
extend

pay

a

it
agreed
to
purchase
the
Electro-Optics
Technology
division
of
Perkin-Elmer

Terms
of
the
agreement
were

for
the
fiscal
year
ended
July
31
,
1988
,
the
most
recent
period
for
which
results
were
broken
out
,
the
Perkin-Elmer
unit
accounted
for
more
than
half
the

million
in

recorded
by
the
company
's
government

Perkin-Elmer

,
said
the
sale
of
the
Danbury

Conn.

is
consistent
with
its
restructuring

announced
in

.

In

to
making
electro-optical

Share
prices
plummeted
across
Europe
yesterday
in
response
to
Friday
's
New
York
sell-off
,
but
some
issues
staged
a
late
comeback
after
Wall
Street
opened
without
another
rout
.

European
investors
have
further
reason
for
optimism
today
,
after
the
U.S.
rebound
.

The
Frankfurt
Stock
Exchange
,
which
closed
before
the
New
York
exchanges
opened
,
was
the
hardest
hit
of
the
major
European
markets
,
with
the
DAX
Index
dropping
12.8
%
.

In
London
,
prices
plummeted
in
early
trading
and
were
off
as
much
as
9
%
before
coming
back
strong
after
the
New
York
opening
to
close
down
only
3.2
%
.

West
German
Economics
Minister
Helmut
Haussmann
said
,
``
In
my
view
,
the
stock
market
will
stabilize
relatively
quickly
.

There
may
be
one
or
other
psychological
or
technical
reactions
,
but
they
are
n't
based
on
fundamentals
.

The
economy
of
West
Germany
and
the
EC
{
European
Community
}
is
highly
stable
.

''

Paris
,
which
has
been
the
center
of
speculation
fever
in
recent
weeks
,
also
was
hard
hit
.

Share
prices
fell
in
Milan
,
Amsterdam
,
Zurich
,
Madrid
and
Stockholm
.

Prices
in
Brussels
,
where
a
computer
breakdown
disrupted
trading
,
also
tumbled
.

Following
is
a
breakdown
of
major
market
activity
:

FRANKFURT
:
One
of
the
sharpest
declines
came
in
the
financial
center
of
Europe
's
strongest
economy
.

The
DAX
Index
of
30
West
German
blue
chips
plunged
12.8
%
,
a
one-day
record
,
wiping
out
the
summer
's
gains
.

The
index
closed
at
1385.72
,
down
203.56
points
.

By
comparison
,
two
years
ago
on
Black
Monday
,
the
new
index
would
have
dropped
9.4
%
,
according
to
a
projection
by
the
exchange
.

Investors
may
have
reacted
so
strongly
to
Friday
's
U.S.
stock
market
loss
because
they
had
vivid
memories
of
the
Frankfurt
exchange
's
losing
35
%
of
its
value
in
the
1987
crash
and
its
wake
.

This
time
,
however
,
many
small
investors
may
have
been
hurt
by
acting
so
swiftly
.

``
They

all
went
in
the
wrong
direction
,
''
said
Andreas
Insam
,
an
investment
adviser
for
the
Bank
in
Liechtenstein
's
Frankfurt
branch
.

He
said
he
told
clients
to
buy
selected
West
German
blue
chips
after
they
fell
by
about
10
%
.

After
the
opening
was
delayed
30
minutes
because
of
the
crush
of
sell
orders
,
Frankfurt
's
normal
two-hour
trading
session
was
extended
75
minutes
to
handle
the
heavy
volume
.

``
The
beginning
was
chaotic
,
''
said
Nigel
Longley
,
a
broker
for
Commerzbank
AG
.

``
It
took
three-quarters
of
an
hour
before
enough
prices
could
be
worked
out
to
get
a
reading
on
the
market
.

''

Institutional
investors
and
bankers
,
many
of
whom
spent
the
night
before
in
their
offices
watching
Far
Eastern
markets
,
were
cautiously
optimistic
after
the
mild
1.8
%
decline
in
Tokyo
stock
prices
.

``
Everybody
was
still
confident
,
including
most
institutional
investors
.

That
is
why
everybody
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
storm
of
sell
orders
from
small
private
investors
,
''
said
Norbert
Braeuer
,
a
senior
trader
for
Hessische
Landesbank
.

Some
big
institutions
,
including
banks
,
began
picking
up
lower-priced
shares
late
yesterday
,
but
most
investors
wanted
to
see
what
would
happen
in
New
York
before
acting
.

But
even
if
Wall
Street
continues
to
stabilize
,
analysts
here
say
the
latest
blow
to
investor
confidence
could
inhibit
a
swift
recovery
for
the
Frankfurt
exchange
,
which
already
was
showing
signs
of
weakness
after
the
DAX
had
slipped
from
a
1989
high
of
1657.61
on
Sept.
8
.

Some
of
West
Germany
's
bluest
chips
took
some
of
the
biggest
hits
.

A
16.3
%
drop
for
Mannesmann
AG
and
Dresdner
Bank
AG
's
9.6
%
decline
were
especially
problematic
for
their
respective
boards
,
whose
plans
for
major
rights
issues
in
November
could
now
be
in
jeopardy
.

Dresdner
Bank
last
month
said
it
hoped
to
raise
1.2
billion
marks
(
$
642.2
million
)
by
issuing
four
million
shares
at
300
marks

each
.

Yet
yesterday
's
market
cropped
Dresdner
's
share
price
by
33
marks
to
309
marks

a
share
,
leaving
little
incentive
for
investors
to
subscribe
to
the
standing
price
unless
the
market
recovers
quickly
.

LONDON
:
Headed
toward
a
record
drop
at
midday
,
the
London

market
recouped
two-thirds

the
wake
of
New

such
as
Norwich
Union
Insurance
Group
,
Scottish
Amicable
Investment
Managers
and
Standard
Life
Assurance
Co.

that
spearheaded
the
rally
.

Attracted
by
low
prices
and
encouraged
by
New

's
performance
,
they
scooped
up
equities
across
the
board
.

Volume
was
959.3

more
than
triple

levels

PARIS
:
Late
buying
gave
the
Paris
Bourse

a
parachute
after
its
free
fall
early
in
the
day
.

The

General

down
5.4

from

Michel
Vigier

a

``
When

was
panic
buying
in

said
that
as
the
news
spread
that

was
moving
up
,
traders

who
had
called
to
place
sell
orders
changed
their
line
in
mid-conversation
,
ordering
buys
instead
.

Trading
was
driven
primarily
by
small
investors
and
speculators
,
with
large
institutions
waiting
on
the
sidelines
until
late
in
the
day
.

When
Wall
Street
turned
,
however
,
the
big
boys
entered
the
market
,
looking
for
bargains
.

Interspec

reported
a
net
loss
of
$
2.4
million
for
the
fiscal
third
quarter
ended
Aug.
31

It
said
the
loss
resulted
from
startup
and
introduction

closed
unchanged
at
$
8.75
.

The
purchase
helps
LAC
make
up
for
a
court
decision
earlier
this
year
in
which

it
lost
a
long
legal
battle
with
Toronto-based
Corona
Corp.
for
control
of
Canada
's
richest
gold
mine
.

The
Bond
International
stake
would
roughly
double
LAC
's
gold
production
and
substantially
reduce
its
average
cost
of
producing
gold
.

Bond
International
is
expected
to
produce
about
600,000
ounces
of
gold
in
the
fiscal
year
ending
June
30
,
of
which
roughly
two-thirds
would
be
attributable
to
LAC
from
the
date

the
acquisition
is
completed
.

LAC
itself
is
expected
to
produce
about
400,000
ounces

this
year
.

Last
year
,
Bond
International
spent
an
average
$
204
to
produce
an
ounce
of
gold
at
mines
in
North
and
South
America
and
in
Australia
,
significantly
lower
than
LAC
's
own
average
cost
of
$
260

an
ounce
.

Analysts
say
the
real
jewel
in
the
Bond
International
crown
is
its
83
%
stake
in
Chile
's
El
Indio
mine
,
which

they
say
had
production
costs
of
below
$
100

an
ounce
.

A
LAC
spokesman
said
the
company
has
``
enough
cash
''
to
pay
for
the
Bond
International
stake
without
borrowing
.

The
spokesman
said
LAC
has
no
intentions
``
right
now
''
to
further
increase
its
stake
in
Bond
International

Dallas-based
National

Chicken
Chains
Ruffled

By
Loss
of
Customers

FAST-FOOD
chicken
chains
,
faced
with
a
worsening
business
slump
,
are
struggling
to
hatch
some
new
marketing
strategies
.

The
Crest
Report
,
which
tracks
consumer
purchases
,
says
customer
traffic
at
chicken
restaurants
fell
10
%
in
the
second
quarter
,
while
the
overall
fast-food
customer
count
was
down
2
%
.

Chicken
business
is
off
largely
because
of
more
competition
from
grocery-store
convenience
food
,
home-delivered
pizza
and
other
takeout
fare
,
says
a
spokesman
for
the
report
,
a
publication
of
NPD
Group
,
a
market
research
firm
in
Port
Washington
,
N.Y
.

The
loss
of
more
customers
is
the
latest
in
a
string
of
problems
.

Church
's
Fried
Chicken
Inc.
and
Popeye
's
Famous
Fried
Chicken
Inc.
,
which
have
merged
,
are
still
troubled
by
overlapping
restaurant
locations
.

Chicken
chains
also
are
feeling
more
pressure
from
McDonald
's
Corp.
,
which
introduced
its
McChicken
sandwich

this
year
and
recently
tested
the
sale
of
individual
pieces
of
chicken
.

New
management
at
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
,
a
unit
of
PepsiCo
Inc.
,
has
fought
back
with
new
medium
and
large
chicken
sandwiches
for
the
lunch
crowd
.

And
the
chain
is
testing
products

that
are
n't
fried
,
such
as
``
char-grilled
''
chicken
,
to
try
to
win
health-conscious
consumers
.

Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
also
is
testing
home-delivery
of
chicken
,
which
could
be
a
hit
with
stay-at-home
diners
.

But
some
fast-food
industry
analysts
say
problems
with
keeping
chicken
warm
and
fresh
must
be
solved
first
.

A
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
spokesman
,
however
,
disputed
the
notion
that
the
delivery
service
experienced
problems
in
some
markets
where
testing
has
been
discontinued
.

He
says
the
test
is
continuing
in
Chicago
,
Columbus
,
Ohio
,
and
a
few
other
cities
.

The
advertising
industry
is
buzzing
with
rumors
that
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
will
drop
Young
&
Rubicam
and
seek
a
new
ad
agency
.

But
the
company
declines
to
comment
.

Emanuel
Goldman
,
a
PaineWebber
Inc.
analyst
,
predicts
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
will
post
an
11
%
drop
in
1989
net
income
.

``
They
've
been
laggard
,
''
he
says
,
``
but
they
'll
have
to
become
more
aggressive
.

Reluctant
Advertisers

Try

Spots

CALL
IT
un-advertising
.

Pittsburgh
consultant
David
Bear
is
selling
a
soft
approach
to
clients

who
want
exposure
yet
shun
pushy
ads
.

His
ploy
:
60-second
radio
spots

that
offer
helpful
hints
.

The
only
plug
for
the
sponsor
is
a
brief
mention
at
the
end
of
the
spot
.

The
messages
resemble
the
Business
Traveler
,
a
daily
dose
of
travel
tips
developed
by
Mr.
Bear
and
sponsored
by
travel
agencies
in
several
major
cities
.

New
un-advertisers
include
Burt
Hill
Kosar
Rittlemann
Associates
,
a
Butler
,
Pa.
,
architectural
firm
.

Its
radio
series
features
such
spots
as
``
Floodlights
:
Evening
Wear
for
Urban
Structures
''
and
``
Building
a
Place
to

.

''
A
harder
sell
,
says
John
Kosar
,
the
firm
's
president
,
would
``
detract
from
the
profession
.

''

Hospitals
have
signed
up
to
use
the
messages
to
promote
fundraisers
,
and
Equitable
Gas
Co.
is
considering
the
format
to
offer
energy
tips
to
consumers
.

But
such
spots
can
be
too
soft
.

``
There
's
always
a
risk
of
lost
messages
,
''
says
John
Fitzgerald
,
chairman
of
Ketchum
Advertising
USA
,
which
created
similar
radio
spots
for
Pittsburgh
National

.

``
It

Retailer
Sees
Pitfalls

In
Environmental
Push

HERE
'S
a
retailer

that
's
getting
tough
in
the
push
for
environmentally
safe
packaging
and
products
.

Big
Bear
Supermarkets
Inc.
,
a
grocery
chain
based
in
San
Diego
,
plans
to
display
shelf
cards
and
distribute
pamphlets
recommending
products
deemed
safe
for
the
environment
.

The
choices
will
be
based
on
research
by
the
San
Diego
Environmental
Health
Coalition
and
will
include
products
like
Murphy
's
Oil
Soap
and
other
noncorrosive
cleaners
.

But
the
chain
is
quickly
realizing
the
pitfalls
of
such
endorsements
.

For
example
,
it
recommends
nonchlorinated
dishwasher
detergent
and
puts
Sunlight
on
its
environmentally
safe
list
.

That
does
n't
thrill
Procter
&
Gamble
Co.
,
maker
of
Cascade
dishwasher
detergent
.

A
company
spokesman
questioned
the
validity
of
the
list
,
noting
that
chlorine
is
present
in
all
major
dishwasher
detergents
.

In
fact
,
Lever
Bros.
confirms
that
its
Sunlight
brand
does
contain
chlorine
bleach
,
even
though
it
is
n't
listed
on
the
label
for
the
powder
version
.

Thomas
G.
Dahlen
,
Big
Bear
's
executive
vice
president
,
said
the
chain
is
still
reviewing
its
product
list
to
avoid
such
problems
.

``
Our
intent
is
to
promote
the
best
alternative
,
''
he
says
.

``
And
it
's
important
that
we
be
accurate
.

''

But
in
the
end
,
customers
'
wishes
are
what
will
prevail
.

Big
Bear
does
n't
care
for
disposable
diapers
,
which
are
n't
biodegradable
.

Yet
parents
demand
them
.

Says
Mr.
Dahlen
,
``
We
'll
still
be
forced
to
sell
items
we
might
not
philosophically
agree
with
.

Odds
and
Ends

NEATNESS
does
count
--
at
least
in
the
grocery
store
.

A
study
by
Safeway
's
Scanner
Marketing
Research
shows
soap
sales
climbed
5
%
when
bars
were
neatly
stacked
on
shelves
instead
of
dumped
in
a
wire
basket
...
.

Which
celebrity
endorsers
are
most
believable
?

For
the
third
year
in
a
row
,
consumers
voted
Bill
Cosby
first
and
James
Garner
second
in
persuasiveness
as
spokesmen
in
TV
commercials
,
according
to
Video
Storyboard
Tests
,
New
York
.

Michael
J.
Fox
replaced
Bruce
Willis
in
third
place
;
Cher
placed
fourth
for
the
second
time
.

J.P.
Industries
Inc.
said
it
signed
a
definitive
agreement
to
sell
its
Builders
'
Hardware
Group
to
closely
held
Nalcor
Inc.
of
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif
.

Terms
were
n't
disclosed
,
but
a
J.P.
Industries
spokesman
said
the
amount
J.P.
Industries
will
get
for
the
group
is
``
a
little
better
than
expected
by
the
marketplace
,
and
the
marketplace
had
been
expecting
$
25
million
to
$
30
million
.

''

The
group
consists
of
Weslock
Corp.
and
JPI
Modern
Inc
.

J.P.
Industries
,
which
is
based
in
Ann
Arbor
,
Mich.
,
said
the
sale
completes
a
previously
announced
program
to
divest
itself
of
its
hardware
and
plumbing
supplies
operations
.

The
company
's
remaining
business
is
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
engine
and
transmissions
products
for
industrial
and
transportation
applications
.

The
dollar
's
fall
on
Friday
could
signal
a
new
bout
of
weakness
for
the
U.S.
currency
and
--
if
it
declines
much
further
--
possibly
the
end
of
the
U.S.
currency
's
long-term
climb

that
began
in
early
1988
.

``
The
entire
sentiment
has
changed
;
the
dollar
bulls
definitely
have
been
shaken
,
''
says
Jack
Kessler
,
senior
vice
president
in
charge
of
New
York
foreign-exchange
operations
for
Chase
Manhattan
Bank
.

He
and
others
cite
Friday
's
plunge
in
U.S.
stock
prices
and
the
narrowing
difference
between
interest
rates
in
the
U.S.
and
some
of
its
major
trading
partners
,
particularly
West
Germany
and
Japan
.

Many
analysts
also
suspect
that
the
Federal
Reserve
has
begun
to
reduce
interest
rates
and
could
go
further
.

Lower
interest
rates
usually
diminish
a
currency
's
appeal
to
international
investors
and
speculators
.

By
very
late
in
New
York
on
Friday
,
the
dollar
had
tumbled
to
1.8655
West
German
marks
and
141.50
yen
--
its
lows
for
the
day
--
from
1.9083
marks
and
144.17
yen
on
Thursday
.

The
British
pound
rose
to
$
1.5840
from
$
1.5523

a
day
earlier
.

In
Tokyo
Monday
,
the
dollar
opened
for
trading
at
139.30
yen
,
down
from
Friday
's
Tokyo
close
of
144
yen
,
and
1.8340
marks
down
from
Friday
's
close
of
1.8720
.

By
late
morning
,
the
dollar
had
recovered
somewhat
and
was
trading
at
140.90
yen
and
1.8535
marks
.

``
If
the
stock
market
keeps
going
down
on
Monday
,
you
're
going
to
see
a
lot
of
people
selling
dollars
,
''
says
Robert
Fio
Rito
,
a
trader
at
Harris
Trust
&
Savings
Bank
in
Chicago
.

He
added
:
``
The
mark
is
a
good
place
to
be
.

''

In
the
short-run
,
the
dollar
's
fate
depends
largely
on
the
performance
of
the
U.S.
stock
market
today
as
well
as
the
Fed
's
and
other
central
banks
'
reaction
to
what
happens
in
all
world
equity
markets
,
say
traders
and
analysts
.

Not
only
does
the
dollar
play
a
key
role
in
determining
the
direction
and
health
of
the
U.S.
economy
,
but
the
speed
with
which

it
rises
or
falls
is
also
of
major
concern
to
U.S.
and
foreign
policy
makers
.

A
precipitous
fall
by
the
dollar
could
reignite
U.S.
inflationary
pressures
by
raising
the
price
of
imports
and
prompting
U.S.
manufacturers
to
increase
domestic
prices
.

But
if
the
U.S.
currency
were
to
decline
in
a
controlled
manner
,
it
would
contribute
to
the
four-year
effort
by
the
U.S.
and
its
major
trading
partners
to
reduce
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
and
correspondingly
large
Japanese
and
West
German
surpluses
.

That
's
because
a
weaker
dollar
makes
U.S.
exports
less
expensive
while
raising
the
price
of
imports
to
American
consumers
.

Furthermore
,
in
the
current
stock
market
climate
,
the
dollar
is
the
wire
through
which
foreigners
telegraph
their
preference
--
or
distaste
--
for
U.S.
securities
and
signal
their
confidence
in
the
American
economy
and
financial
system
.

If
foreigners
dump
U.S.
stocks
and
return
to
the
safety
of
their
home
markets
--
as
they
did
in
October
1987
--
they
must
simultaneously
also
sell
dollars
for
their
own
currencies
.

Those
transactions
,
in
turn
,
could
weaken
the
dollar
.

Even
if
foreigners
just
withhold
from
buying
additional
U.S.
securities
,
they
reduce
the
demand
for
dollars
.

Conversely
,
when
foreigners
buy
American
securities
,
they
increase
the
demand
for
the
U.S.
currency
.

However
,
foreigners

who
merely
sell
their
American
shares
and
buy
U.S.
bonds
do
n't
affect
the
exchange
rate
.

Initially
on
Friday
,
the
dollar
shot
up
in
early
New
York
activity
after
both

the
producer
price
index
and
retail
sales
for
September
came
out
higher
than
most
analysts
expected
.

Traders
concluded
that
U.S.
interest
rates
would
remain
firm
,
and
the
dollar
quickly
climbed
to
its
intraday
highs
of
1.9140
marks
and
144.80
yen
.

But
the
rally
quickly
fizzled
under
the
weight
of
trader
chagrin
that
the
currency
had
n't
risen
further
,
profit-taking
and
unconfirmed
reports
that
the
Fed
was
selling
dollars
.

A
few
hours
later
with
the
dollar
trading
at
1.8895
marks
and
143
yen
,
the
stock
market
began
plunging
,
taking
the
U.S.
currency
with
it
.

Surprisingly
,
while
trading
was
hectic
,
dealers
say
that
volume
was
unexpectedly
moderate
.

``
You
're
talking
about
a
really
thin
and
volatile
Friday

the
13th
,
''
says
Carmine
Rotondo
,
chief
corporate
dealer
for
Security
Pacific
National
Bank
.

``
The
decline
of
the
dollar
was
more
a
function
of
market
makers
dragging
bids
down
than
people
massively
selling
,
''
adds
Richard
Witten
,
vice
president
in
charge
of
foreign-exchange
operations
at
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.

From
its
intraday
highs
four
weeks
ago
,
the
U.S.
currency
has
fallen
almost
7
%
against
the
mark
and
5
%
against
the
yen
.

In
Friday
's
trading
alone
the
dollar
fell
more
than
2.5
%
against
the
mark
and
2.3
%
against
the
yen
from
its
high
in
early
New
York
trading
.

Currently
,
the
dollar
stands
close
to
the
upper
limits
of
its
so-called
Louvre
trading
ranges
of
1.70-to-1.90
marks
and
120-140
yen
,
within
which

most
traders
and
economists
believe
the
Group
of
Seven
major
industrial
countries
have
tried
to
keep
it
since
February
1987
.

The
G-7
includes
the
U.S.
,
Japan
,
West
Germany
,
France
,
Britain
,

.

``
For
all
of
its
unfortunate
aspects
,
Friday
's
events
make
it
easier
for
the
G-7
process
to
continue
,
''
says
Robert
Feldman
,
an
international
economist
at
Salomon
Brothers
Inc
.

He

added
:
``
Until
Friday
morning
,
market
people
were
contending
that
further
interest-rate
hikes
were
necessary
to
keep
the
dollar
bulls
from
running
over
{
the
central
banks
}
;
there
seemed
to
be
a
sense
of
the
dollar
bulls
coming
back
and
taking
control
again
.

''

In
the
past
week
and
a
half
,
major
European
countries
--
led
by
West
Germany
and
Japan
--
raised
official
domestic
interest
rates
,
mostly
to
keep
their
currencies
from
falling
further
and
to
stem
the
inflationary
impact
of
those
declines
.

Mr.
Feldman
added
:
``
But
that
's
not
the
way
things
look
now
;
the
G-7
have
some
breathing
room
.

''

Analysts
say
that
the
dollar
's
future
depends
on
whether
U.S.
stock
prices
keep
falling
;
whether
the
Fed
is
forced
to
ease
credit
to
ease
any
crisis
;
whether
foreign
equity
markets
also
fall
,
and
how
central
banks
abroad
react
to
those
circumstances
.

Many
dealers
are
betting
that
the
Fed
will
have
to
ease
monetary
policy
,
if
it

has
n't
already
.

The
questions
are
how
much
and
under
what
circumstances
.

``
If
nothing
happens
abroad
and
the
Fed
is
forced
to
ease
here
to
calm
markets
,
the
dollar
is
going
to
go
down
;
there
would
be
a
flight
to
quality
as
people
start
to
worry
about
the
U.S.
financial
system
,
''
says
Michael
D.
Andrews
,
a
vice
president
at
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co
.

The
dollar
,
he
adds
,
``
could
take
a
pretty
big
hit
,
''
if
the
Fed
were
perceived
as
``
being
in
a
very
difficult
situation
where
it
was
fighting
a
fire
.

''

In
fact
,
Mr.
Andrews
and
some
other
traders
and
analysts
say
that
it
is
n't
impossible
to
paint
a
scenario
where
the
Fed
might
have
to
intervene
to
support
the
dollar
.

Analysts
believe
that
the
Fed
can
tolerate
a
dollar
as
low
as
1.80
marks
,
a
level
at
which

U.S.
companies
are
competitive
in
overseas
markets
and
yet
is
n't
too
inflationary
domestically
.

Much
depends
on
how
foreigners
react
.

If
they
merely
sell
American
shares
and
buy
U.S.
bonds
,
that
wo
n't
affect
the
dollar
.

But
if
,
as
in
October
1987
,
they
dump
dollar-denominated
securities
and
run
to
foreign
markets
,
they
will
increase
pressure
on
the
dollar
to
fall
.

Some
of
that
already
began
on
Friday
.

``
Many
of
the
banks
in
the
U.S.
called
their
counterparts
in
the
Far
East
and
Europe
,
''
says
Chase
Manhattan
's
Mr.
Kessler
.

``
And
dealers

who
had
gone
home
in
the
Far
East
and
Europe
long
dollars
started
selling
when
they
were
awakened
during
the
night
and
told
that
the
stock
market
was
down
,
that
Fed
funds
were
at
8
%
and
that
the
Fed
might
begin
to
ease
,
''
Mr.
Kessler
adds
.

Salomon
Brothers
'
Mr.
Feldman
says
that
further
evidence
of
foreign
selling
was
the
dollar
's
plunge
Friday
at
the
same
time

the
bond
market
was
rallying
--
which
has
n't
occurred
in
months
.

``
That
may
be
a
signal
of
a
turning
point
in
the
strategies
of
international
portfolio
managers
,
''
he
says
.

Harris
Trust
's
Mr.
Fio
Rito
predicts
that
``
an
equity
market
hit
will
trigger
further
liquidation
;
with
the
Japanese
and
Germans
raising
{
interest
}
rates
,
the
fundamentals
changed
for
the
dollar
.

''

Indeed
,
Salomon
's
Mr.
Feldman
notes
that
in
September
yields
on
three-month
Eurodollar
deposits
were
1.5
percentage
points
more
than
on
three-month
marks
.

By
late
Friday
,
that
spread
had
narrowed
to
0.19
percentage
point
.

``
People
began
to
question
shifting
{
funds
}
for
differences

this
small
,
''
he
adds
.

Many
dealers
are
looking
to
see
if
the
dollar
tumbles
below
1.85
marks
,
a
key
psychological
and
technical
level
to
the
many
traders

who
use
charts
to
predict
currency
movements
.

``
It
breaks
through
1.85
,
then
you
begin
to
question
whether
the
dollar
's
long-term
uptrend

that
began
in
early
1988
is
still
in
place
,
''
says
Merrill
Lynch
's
Mr.
Andrews
.

The
dollar
is
n't
without
its
boosters
,
who
point
to
reduced
U.S.
budget
and
trade
deficits
as
well
as
its
value
as
a
so-called
haven
currency
in
a
world
rife
with
political
instability
.

``
I
see
a
stronger
dollar
mid
to
long-term
,
''
says
Gilles
Bazy-Sire
,
a
first
vice
president
at
Societe
Generale
Securities
Corp.
in
New
York
.

He
says
that
based
on
the
price
of
a
similar
basket
of
goods
and
services
in
major
industrial
countries
,
the
dollar
currently
``
is
very
cheap
.

''
That
,
he
says
,
``
should
increase
the
demand
for
dollars
''
by
investors

who
want
to
buy
real
U.S.
assets
,
such
as
real
estate
and
companies
.

Dollar
doubters
point
to
the
prospects
of
a
bumpy
U.S.
stock
market
at
best
,
and
the
prospect
of
lower
U.S.
interest
rates
.

What
's
more
,
many
forecasters
predict
that
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
will
begin
to
widen
again
in
1990
.

In
fact
,
many
analysts
estimate
that
the
trade
gap
for
August
--
to
be
released
tomorrow
--
widened
to
as
much
as
$
9.6
billion
from
$
7.6
billion

the
previous
month
.

Barring
a
catastrophe
in
the
U.S.
stock
market
,
Mr.
Kessler
believes
that
the
dollar
in
the
near
term
should
weaken
further
to
about
1.8650-1.8850
marks
and
142-143.50
yen
.

But
he
adds
:
``
My
gut
feeling
is
that
we
can
even
see
it
go
lower
.

of
the
commission
charged
with
overseeing
the
election
's
fairness
,
Bryan
O'Linn
,
was
openly
sympathetic
to
SWAPO
.

Shortly
after
that
,
Mr.
O'Linn
had
Scott
Stanley
arrested
and
his
passport
confiscated
.

Mr.
Stanley
is
on
trial
over
charges
that
he
violated
a
proclamation
,
issued
by
the
South
African
administrator
general
earlier
this
year
,
which
made
it

a
crime
punishable
by
two
years
in
prison
for
any
person
to
``
insult
,
disparate
or
belittle
''
the
election
commission
.

The
Stanley
affair
does
n't
bode
well
for
the
future
of
democracy
or
freedom
of
anything
in
Namibia
when
SWAPO
starts
running
the
government
.

To
the
extent
Mr.
Stanley
has
done
anything
wrong
,
it
may
be
that
he
is
out
of
step
with
the
consensus
of
world
intellectuals
that
the
Namibian
guerrillas
were
above
all
else
the
victims
of
suppression
by
neighboring
South
Africa
.

SWAPO
has
enjoyed
favorable
Western
media
treatment
ever
since
the
U.N.
General
Assembly
declared
it

the
``
sole
,
authentic
representative
''
of
Namibia
's
people
in

Last
year
,
the
U.S.
brokered
a
peace
settlement
to
remove
Cuba
's
``
Afrika
Korps
''
from
Angola
and
hold
``
free
and
fair
''
elections

that
would
end
South
Africa
's
control
of
Namibia
.

The
elections
are
set
for
Nov.
7
.

In
July
,
Mr.
Stanley
,
editor
of
American
Press
International
,
a
Washington
D.C.-based
conservative
wire
service
,
visited
Namibia
to
report
on
the
U.N.-monitored
election
campaign
.

He
interviewed
Mr.
O'Linn
,
head
of
a
commission
charged
with
investigating
electoral
intimidation
,
and
reported
that
Mr.
O'Linn
was
openly
sympathetic
to
SWAPO
and
indeed
had
defended
its
leaders
in
court
.

After
Mr.
Stanley
's
article
was
published
in
two
Namibian
newspapers
,
Mr.
O'Linn
had
criminal
charges
brought
against
their
editors
,
publisher
and
lawyer
.

Mr.
Stanley
was
arrested
and
charged
along
with
the
others
when
he
returned
to
Namibia

this
month
.

Both

the
State
Department
and
the
Lawyers
Committee
for
Freedom
of
the
Press
have
protested
Mr.
Stanley
's
detention
.

Mr.
Stanley
's
arrest
is
the
latest
in
a
series
of
incidents

that
threaten
to
derail
Namibia
's
elections
.

Both
South
African
and
SWAPO
extremists
are
intimidating
voters
.

The
U.S.
is
in
the
habit
of
arranging
peace
settlements
and
then
washing
its
hands
over
the
tragic
results
.

It
now
has
the
chance
to
redress
that
record
in
Namibia
.

State
and
the
human-rights
community
should
insist
that
Mr.
Stanley
and
his
fellow
defendants
be
released
and
that
the
United
Nation
's
monitors
make
certain
that
Mr.
O'Linn's
commission
investigates
election
complaints
from
all
sides
.

BSN
S.A.
,
a
leading
French
food
group
,
said
it
agreed
to
acquire
Birkel
G.m.b
.

H.
,
a
West
German
pasta
maker
.

The
value
of
the
acquisition
was
n't
disclosed
.

The
move
is
in
line
with
BSN
's
strategy
of
gradually
building
its
share
of
the
European
pasta
market
through
external
growth
.

BSN
will
initially
acquire
a
15
%
interest
in
Birkel
,
a
closely
held
concern
.

The
French
group
has
an
agreement
giving
it

the
right
to
buy
all
the
shares
outstanding
,
and
this
could
be
completed
within
a
few
months
,
a
BSN
spokeswoman
said
.

The
takeover
was
submitted
for
approval
by
the
West
German
cartel
office
,
BSN
said
.

Birkel
is
West
Germany
's
second-biggest
producer
of
pasta
,
with
sales
of
250
million
marks
(
$
133.4
million
)
in
1988
.

It
has
750
workers
at
three
production
units
in
southwest
Germany
,
and
is
that
nation
's
leading
producer
of
pasta
sauces
.

The
acquisition
strengthens
BSN
's
position
in
the
European
pasta
market
.

The
French
group
currently
ranks
second
after
Barilla
Group
of
Italy
,
whose
sales
are
chiefly
in
the
Italian
market
.

The
Federal
Reserve
gave
comfort
to
the
financial
markets
yesterday
by
allowing
a
key
interest
rate
to
drift
downward
.

In
addition
,
Fed
Chairman
Alan
Greenspan
attempted
to
calm
the
markets
by
denying
reports

he
was
publicly
feuding
with
the
Treasury
.

The
Fed
allowed
the
key
federal
funds
interest
rate
to
dip
to
about
8
%
from
its
levels
of
just
below
9
%
last
week
.

That
was
a
sign
to
financial
markets

that
,
at
least
for
now
,
the
Fed
was
easing
its
grip
on
credit
.

Because
the
markets
remained
relatively
calm
,
however
,
the
Fed
did
n't
have
to
inject
massive
amounts
of
money
into
the
banking
system
,
as
it
did
in
October
1987
.

The
fed
funds
rate
is
the
rate
banks
charge
on
loans
to
each
other
.

The
Federal
Reserve
can
heavily
influence
that
rate
by
buying
and
selling
securities
to
financial
institutions
.

``
I
view
this
morning
's
action
as
hand
holding
for
the
financial
markets
,
''
said
Steven
Wood
,
an
economist
with
Bank
of
America
.

He
said
the
Fed
showed
it
was
willing
to
provide
more
money
to
the
financial
system
,
but
it

was
n't
clear
``
how
much
or
for
how
long
.

''

Mr.
Greenspan
appeared
in
public
briefly
yesterday
morning
to
deliver
a
speech
to
the
American
Bankers
Association
convention
here
.

In
a
brief
comment
before
the
speech
,
he
said
he
was
``
surprised
''
that
some
people
interpreted
his
recent
comments
in
Moscow
``
as
endeavoring
to
say
something
about
current
monetary
or
foreign
exchange
policies
.

''
While
visiting
Moscow
last
week
,
the
Fed
chairman
had
warned
that
``
attempts
to
maintain
unrealistic
exchange
rates
''
may
be
destabilizing
--
a
comment
some
interpreted
as
criticism
of
the
Treasury
's
efforts
to
push
down
the
dollar
.

``
I
hope
my
colleagues
at
the
Gosbank
{
the
Soviet
central
bank
}
do
n't
misinterpret
anything

I
said
today
,
''
the
Fed
chairman
joked
before
beginning
the
prepared
text
of
his
speech
.

Mr.
Greenspan
also
tried
to
reassure
the
markets
by
saying
that
``
we
at
the
Federal
Reserve
are
watching
the
financial
markets
rather
closely
.

''
He
said
the
Fed
was
coordinating
its
activities
with
foreign
officials
,
and
that
``
coordination
exists
at
a
detailed
level
here
in
the
U.S.
among
the
Federal
Reserve
,
the
SEC
,
the
CFTC
and
the
Treasury
.

''

The
Fed
's
move
to
ease
credit
was
n't
an
aggressive
one
,
but
it
did
signal

a
clear
change
of
policy
from
before
the
stock
market
's
swoon
.

Government
officials
say
it
's
unclear
,
however
,
where
the
bellwether
fed
funds
rate
,
which
influences
other
interest
rates
,
will
come
to
rest
.

If
the
financial
markets
continue
to
show
nervousness
,
the
Fed
may
keep
it
close
to
8
%
.

If
problems
quickly
disappear
,
the
Fed
may
nudge
the
rate
up
to
8
.

Bush
administration
officials
were
pleased
with
the
Fed
's
action
,
and
shared
Mr.
Greenspan
's
view
that
there
was
close
coordination
among
the
various
government
agencies
.

On
Sunday
,
for
instance
,
Treasury
Secretary
Nicholas
Brady
held
a
lengthy
meeting
with
Mr.
Greenspan
and
SEC
Chairman
Richard
Breeden
to
evaluate
information
on
Friday
's
market
plunge
.

At
that
time
,
they
concluded
that
the
drop
was
concentrated
among
takeover
stocks
,
and
that
there
were
no
fundamental
reasons

it
should
turn
into
a
rout
Monday
morning
.

The
administration
also
benefited
from
the
expertise
of
Treasury
Undersecretary
Robert
Glauber
and
Assistant
Secretary
David
Mullins
,
two
former
Harvard
professors

who
had
headed
up
the
Brady
Commission
's
effort
to
investigate
the
1987
crash
.

The
two
men
studied
the
order
imbalances
in
the
stock
markets
and
the
level
of
stock
index
futures
to
determine
what
might
happen
Monday
morning
.

That
led
administration
officials
to
predict
,
accurately
,
that
on
Monday

the
market
would
have
to
drop
60
to
100
points
before
any
recovery
could
begin
.

Some
analysts
have
said
disagreements
between
the
Treasury
and
the
Fed
added
to
an
environment

that
allowed
Friday
's
steep
market
decline
to
occur
.

For
weeks
prior
to
the
market
's
drop
,
the
Treasury
had
been
urging
the
Fed
to
bring
down
short-term
interest
rates
,
and
the
Fed
had
been
resisting
.

Also
,
Fed
Vice
Chairman
Manuel
Johnson
and
Wayne
Angell
,
another
member
of
the
reserve
board
,
had
objected
,
in
a
vote
made
public
Oct.
6
,
to
the
Treasury
's
efforts
to
push
down
the
dollar
by
selling
currency
in
foreign
exchange
markets
.

Mr.
Greenspan
was
also
known
to
be
privately
unenthusiastic
about
the
Treasury
's
orders
for
massive
dollar
sales
.

His
comments
in
Moscow
last
week
were
interpreted
by
some
as
a
subtle
attempt
to
make
those
concerns
public
.

Separately
,
David
Ruder
,
who
left
the
chairmanship
of
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
two
weeks
ago
,
says
investors
should
view
market
volatility
as
a
fact
of
modern
market
life
.

``
I
do
not
regard
the
amount
of
the
decline
on
Friday
as
unexpected
or
unlikely
,
''
he
said
in
a
telephone
interview
.

``
With
the
market
being
up
to
2,700
or
2,800
and
the
existence
of
derivative
products
...

one
can
expect
volatility
of
the
magnitude

we
had
.

''

But
he
asked
that
institutional
investors
take
a
socially
responsible
role
in
supporting
the
market
.

``
Institutional
investors
bear
a
responsibility
to
not
only
not
sell
but
to
step
up
and
buy
without
waiting
for
the
market
to
bottom
,
''
Mr.
Ruder
said
.

Mr.
Ruder
,
now
a
professor
at
the
Northwestern
University
School
of
Law
in
Chicago
,
also
expressed
concern
about
two
pauses
in
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
futures
pits
after
prices
had
fallen
and
circuit
breakers
kicked
in
.

Noting
that
the
Dow
Jones
industrials
continued
to
fall
as
the
futures
were
spared
further
carnage
,
Mr.
Ruder
said
,
``
I
think
that
's
something

that
needs
to
be
looked
at
very
carefully
.

The
House
Aviation
Subcommittee
approved
a
bill

that
would
give
the
transportation
secretary
authority
to
review
and
approve
leveraged
buy-outs
of
major
U.S.
airlines
.

The
collapsed
plan
to
acquire
UAL
Corp.
,
parent
of
United
Airlines
,
spurred
quick
action
on
the
legislation
,
introduced
Wednesday
and
approved
by
the
subcommittee
on
a
voice
vote
yesterday
.

The
bill
is
expected
to
be
taken
up
by
the
Public
Works
and
Transportation
Committee
tomorrow
,
and
a
floor
vote
by
next
week
will
be
urged
.

The
measure
drew
criticism
from
the
Bush
administration
and
a
parting
shot
from
financier
Donald
Trump
,
who
yesterday
withdrew
his
takeover
bid
for
AMR
Corp.
,
the
parent
of
American
Airlines
.

In
a
letter
to
subcommittee
Chairman
James
Oberstar
(
D.
,
Minn.
)
,
Mr.
Trump
criticized
the
bill
as
an
explicit
effort
to
thwart
his
bid
for
AMR
,
and
said
it
contributed
to
the
collapse
of
the
deal
.

Elaine
Chao
,
deputy
transportation
secretary
,
also
sent
a
letter
to
express
the
administration
's
opposition
to
the
bill
``
in
its
present
form
.

''

Rep.
Oberstar
brushed
off
Mr.
Trump
's
allegations
as
an
``
excuse
for
his
own
deal
failing
.

''
He
also
said
the
fact
that
the
other
letter
had
n't
come
from
Transportation
Secretary
Samuel
Skinner
indicated
there
is
``
wiggle
room
''
in
the
administration
's
position
.

Mr.
Oberstar
and
other
committee
members
repeatedly
stressed
that
the
legislation
was
n't

a
response
to
any
particular
market
situation
.

But
they
cited
the
UAL
and
AMR
examples
as
reasons
to
move
quickly
to
enact
this
legislation
.

Aides

both
in
the
House
and
Senate
said
the
withdrawal
of
the
Trump
bid
for
AMR
is
n't
likely
to
deflate
efforts
to
push
the
legislation
.

``
It
's
still
on
the
fast
track
and
we
still
want
to
do
it
,
''
said
one
Senate
aide
.

The
bill
is
aimed
at
addressing
the
concern
that
an
airline
might
sacrifice
costly
safety
measures
to
pay
off
the
debt
incurred
in
a
leveraged
buy-out
.

Currently
,
the
transportation
secretary
does
n't
have
clearly
established
authority
to
block
mergers
,
but
can
take
the
drastic
step
of
revoking
the
operating
certificate
of
any
carrier

the
official
considers
unfit
.

Supporters
of
the
legislation
view

the
bill
as
an
effort
to
add
stability
and
certainty
to
the
airline-acquisition
process
,
and
to
preserve
the
safety
and
fitness
of
the
industry
.

In
general
,
the
bill
would
give
the
Transportation
Department

a
30-day
review
period
before
15
%
or
more
of
the
voting
stock
of
a
major
U.S.
air
carrier
could
be
acquired
.

It
also
would
require
the
acquiring
party
to
notify
the
transportation
secretary
and
to
provide
all
information
relevant
to
determining
the
intent
of
the
acquisition
.

The
bill
would
allow
the
secretary
to
reject
a
buy-out
if
sufficient
information
has
n't
been
provided
,
or
if
the
buy-out
is
likely
to
weaken
the
carrier
financially
,
result
in
a
substantial
reduction
in
size
of
the
airline
through
disposal
of
assets
,
or
give
control
to
a
foreign
interest
.

If
more
information
is
needed
,
the
secretary
would
have
authority
to
extend
the
review
period
20
days
.

All
the
witnesses
,
both

congressmen
and
industry
experts
,
expressed
support
for
the
bill
in
order
to
prevent
profiteers
from
cashing
in
on
airline
profits
at
the
expense
of
safe
,
cost-effective
service
.

But
several
committee
members
disapproved
,
some
backing
Mr.
Trump
's
claim
that
the
threat
of
regulation
caused
the
failure
of
the
UAL
deal
and
the
stock-market
plunge
.

One
of
the
major
concerns
expressed
by
the
dissenters
was
that
large
airlines
would
be
prohibited
from
divesting
themselves
of
smaller
entities
and
producing
independent
spin-off
companies
.

Dallas
investor
Harold
Simmons
,
who
has
been
gobbling
up
Lockheed
Corp.
shares
and
only
two
months
ago
told
this
newspaper
that
he
was
in
the
stock
for
the
long
term
,
now
insists
he
wants
to
sell
.

In
an
interview
published
yesterday
with
the
Los
Angeles
Daily
News
,
Mr.
Simmons
said
:
``
Lockheed
is
actually
just
a
decoy
.

I
have
several
decoys
out
there
because
there
's
really
something
else
that
I
want
to
slip
up
on
.

You
've
got
to
put
out
misinformation
if
you
really
want
to
buy
something
for
a
fair
price
.

''

Mr.
Simmons
,
who
holds
6.6
million
shares
,
or
a
10.43
%
stake
,
in
Lockheed
,
added
that
he
is
n't
at
all
interested
in
taking
over
the
Calabasas
,
Calif.
,
aerospace
concern
.

``
Not
now
and
not
ever
,
''
he
told
the
newspaper
.

``
Actually
,
I
wish
I
were
out
of
Lockheed
.

The
defense
industry
seems
to
be
getting
more
uncertain
all
the
time
.

So
I
'm
a
seller
.

Put
it
in
big
black
letters
and
underline
it

Lockheed
's
share
price
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
has
been
propped
up
in
recent
weeks
,
despite
disappointing
earnings
,
because
of
Mr.
Simmons
's
interest
in
the
company
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
Lockheed
slipped
$
1
in
Friday
's
market
slump
to
close
at
$
48

a
share
.

Michael

,
who
closely
tracks
Mr.
Simmons
's
holdings
for
a
Kansas
City
,
Mo.
,
firm
called
Wealth
Monitors
,
said
he
is
skeptical
about
the
stated
intention
to
sell
off
Lockheed
shares
.

He
added
that
while
one
Simmons
holding
company
,
Valhi
Inc.
,
has
sold
272,000
Lockheed
shares
in
recent
months
,
his
other
companies
have
bought
up
880,000
.

``
Does
that
sound
like
a
seller
to
you
?

''
Mr.
Lamb
said
yesterday
.

``
It
just
does
n't
make
any
sense
.

''

Mr.
Simmons
could
n't
be
reached
to
elaborate
,
and
Lockheed
officials
could
n't
be
reached
to
comment
on
the
Daily
News
article
.

But
Mr.
Lamb
said
it

's
Mr.
Simmons
's
style
to
try
and
leave
Wall
Street
befuddled
.

He
said
Mr.
Simmons
knows
the
arbitrage
community
``
can
be
a
detriment
by
driving
the
share
price
up
.

''
Mr.
Lamb
said
if
the
arbitrageurs
get
confused
,
maybe
they
'll
move
out
of
the
stock
and
leave
more
for
Mr.
Simmons
to
grab
.

Intel
Corp.
said
it
reached
an
agreement
with
Alliant
Computer
Systems
Corp.
to
develop
software
standards
for
Intel
's
i860
microprocessor
.

The
i860
,
introduced
earlier
this
year
,
is
Intel
's
entry
in
the
crowded
market
for
reduced
instruction
set
computing
,
or
RISC
,
computers
.

Intel
,
based
in
Santa
Clara
,
Calif.
,
is
the
market
leader
for
traditional
microprocessors
with
its
8086
family

that
forms
the
heart
of
IBM-compatible
personal
computers
.

Under
the
agreement
,
Intel
will
invest
$
3
million
to
acquire
a
4
%
stake
in
Alliant
,
a
maker
of
minisupercomputers
for
scientists
and
engineers
.

Alliant
,
based
in
Littleton
,
Mass.
,
will
license
its
parallel-computing
technologies
to
Intel
,
providing
users

a
way
to
let
many
i860
microprocessors
in
a
single
computer
work
on
a
problem
simultaneously
.

Alliant
said
it
plans
to
use
the
microprocessor
in
future
products
.

It
declined
to
discuss
its
plans
for
upgrading
its
current
product
line
.

First
,
there
was
a
death
watch
.

Then
exhilaration
.

Spurred
by
waves
of
large-scale
buying
in
blue-chip
stocks
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
rallied
yesterday
and
erased
about
a
half
of
Friday
's
190.58-point
plunge
,
gaining
88.12
to
2657.38
.

It
was
the
fourth-biggest
advance
for
the
average
of
30
blue
chips
,
on
frenetic
New
York
Stock
Exchange
volume
of
416,290,000
shares
--
the
highest
since
the
days
after
the
1987
crash
.

While
the
advance
cheered
investors

who
feared
a
1987-style
crash
would
occur
yesterday
,
it
was
strictly
a
big-stock
rally
fed
by
huge
buying
by
bargain-hunting
institutions
and
program
traders
.

A
troubling
sign
:
Declining
stocks
on
the
Big
Board
outnumbered
advancers
,
975
to
749
,
and
the
over-the-counter
market

that
includes
many
smaller
stocks
suffered
aftershocks
of
Friday
's
late
Big
Board
plunge
.

The
Nasdaq
OTC
index
closed
down
6.31
to
460.98
.

Meanwhile
,
in
a
divergence
in
two
of
the
market
's
most
important
indicators
,
the
Dow
industrials
'
sister
average
,
the
20-stock
Dow
Jones
Transportation
Average
,
tumbled
102.06
to
1304.23
--
its
second-worst
decline
next
to
the
164.78-point
fall
during
the
1987
crash
.

Transports
plunged
on
takeover
disappointments
in
two
airline
stocks
,
UAL
and
AMR
,
which

each
fell
more
than
20
%
when
they
reopened
for
trading
yesterday
after
being
suspended
Friday
afternoon
.

UAL
,
the
takeover
stock
at
the
center
of
Friday
's
190.58-point
market
plunge
,
fell
56
to
222
on
nearly
2.3
million
shares
.

Overall
,
``
this
is
a
pleasant
rally
but
it
's
very
selective
,
''
said
Arthur
Cashin
Jr.
,
a
veteran
PaineWebber
Inc.
trader
at
the
Big
Board
.

``
Everyone
was
a
little
concerned
about
the
general
narrowness
of
the
rally
and
failure
of
the
OTC
market
to
get
into
plus
territory
.

It
's
just
a
strange
feeling
.

I
do
n't
think
anyone
left
the
place
whistling
Dixie
.

''

The
rally
gave
credence
,
at
least
for
now
,
to
the
pre-trading
declaration
of
Big
Board
Chairman
John
J.
Phelan
Jr.
that
Friday
's
market
debacle
was
``
an
abnormal
condition
,
and
not
a
disaster
.

''

But
to
traders
,
it
looked
like
disaster
on
the
9:30
a.m.
opening
bell
.

The
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
opened
down
1.64
shortly
after
9:30
.

But
most
of
the
30
blue-chip
stocks
in
the
average
,
including
Eastman
Kodak
and
General
Motors
,
could
n't
trade
because
of
the
heavy
backlog
of
sell
orders
left
over
from
Friday
's
late-afternoon
rout
.

At
9:45
,
Procter
&
Gamble
--
one
of
the
most
important
Dow
bellwethers
of
late
--
opened
down
2
to
117
.

The
Dow
dropped
to
a
quick
27-point
loss
,
and
to
many
traders

it
looked
as
if
stocks
were
headed
for
yet
another
big
tumble
.

More
stocks
opened
over
the
ensuing
half
hour
,
as
the
49
Big
Board
specialist
firms
in
charge
of
keeping
the
market
orderly
groped
to
find
buy
orders
from
major
brokerage
firms
to
match
the
selling
flood
.

Then
,
to
make
matters
worse
,
computerized
sell
programs
kicked
in
,
hammering
stocks
into
steeper
losses
.

There
was
heavy
stock-index
arbitrage
,
as
traders
sold
big
baskets
of
stock
and
bought
stock-index
futures
to
profit
from
the
price
discrepancies
between
the
two
markets
.

This
was
a
hangover
from
Friday
,
when
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
futures
had
closed
at
a
sharp
discount
to
stocks
.

The
onslaught
of
the
program
selling
dashed
any
hopes
that
some
of
the
big
program
trading
firms
would
hold
off
until
the
market
stabilized
.

They
did
n't
.

The
Dow
accelerated
its
slide
,
losing
63.52
in
the
first
40
minutes
of
trading
.

With
program
traders
seemingly
in
charge
,
buyers
backed
away
from
the
market
and
watched
stocks
fall
.

Then
at
10:15

the
Dow
suddenly
started
to
rebound
,
and
when
it
shot
upward
it
did
so
even
faster
than
the
early-morning
fall
.

And
this
time
,
it
was
n't
just
the
program
traders

who
were
responsible
.

All
the
selling
had
pushed
stocks
to
such
cheap
values
that
big
investment
banks
and
major
money
management
firms
started
buying
stocks
heavily
.

The
program
traders
were
in
there
,
too
,
of
course
.

But
according
to
one
trader
,
the
programmers
``
did
n't
look
as
dominant
on
the
upside
as
on
the
downside
because
there
was
{
also
}
a
lot
of
bargain-hunting
''
by
institutions
.

Roland
M.
Machold
,
director
of
the
New
Jersey
Division
of
Investment
,
which
oversees
$
29
billion
in
investments
,
said
the
``
first
thing

we
did
was
to
double
our
orders
''
yesterday
morning
.

``
With
the
market
down
like
this
,
we
'll
probably
take
another
$
50
million
and
put
it
in
''
the
market
.

Trading
in
Walt
Disney
Co.
particularly
caught
traders
'
eyes
.

According
to
Big
Board
officials
,
Disney
had
one
of
the
biggest
sell-order
imbalances
on
Friday
;
it
was
one
of
the
seven
stocks

that
could
n't
finish
trading
that
day
.

The
stock
opened
late
at
114
,
down
8
.

But
then
it
shot
upward
7
as
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
stepped
in
and
bought
,
traders
said
.

However
,
Disney
specialist
Robert
Fagenson
said
:
``
I
would
be
surprised
if
Goldman
represented
4
%
of
the
opening
volume
.

''

Around
Wall
Street
,
trading
desks
were
relieved
that
they
could
at
least
play

the
market
yesterday
,
in
contrast
to
Friday
's
gridlock
.

At
Donaldson
,
Lufkin
&
Jenrette
Inc.
,
head
equity
trader
Dudley
Eppel
said
:
``
I
think
the
opening
was
constructive
.

It
was
orderly
.

We
put
some
orders
together
.

There
was
n't
a
lot
of
panic
selling
,
either
domestically
or
internationally
...
.

Not
like
Friday
where
they
just
took
{
the
market
}
apart
.

''

Still
,
the
market
had
n't
yet
crossed
into
positive
territory
,
and
traders
were
glum
.

But
in
another
dramatic
burst
,
the
Dow
tacked
on
42
points
in
five
minutes
,
and
at
10:25

the
index
showed
a
gain
of
5.74
.

On
the
Big
Board
floor
and
on
trading
desks
,
traders
yelped
their
approval
.

Grinned
Griffith
Peck
,
a
trader
in
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
's
OTC
department
:
``
I
tell
you
,
this
market
acts
healthy
.

''
Around
him
,
scores
of
traders
seemed
to
get
a
burst
of
energy
;
their
boss
broke
out
bottles
of
Perrier
water
to
cool
them
off
.

Among
Big
Board
specialists
,
the
cry
was
``
Pull
your
offers
''
--
meaning
that
specialists
soon
expected
to
get
higher
prices
for
their
shares
.

``
It
was
bedlam
on
the
upside
,
''
said
one
Big
Board
specialist
.

But
not
everybody
was
making
money
.

The
carnage
on
the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
,
the
nation
's
major
options
market
,
was
heavy
after
the
trading
in
S&P
100
stock-index
options
was
halted
Friday
.

Many
market
makers
in
the
S&P
100
index
options
contract
had
bullish
positions
Friday
,
and
when
the
shutdown
came
they
were
frozen
with
huge
losses
.

Over
the
weekend
,
clearing
firms
told
the
Chicago
market
makers
to
get
out
of
their
positions
at
any
cost
Monday
morning
.

``
They
were
absolutely
killed
,
slaughtered
,
''
said
one
Chicago-based
options
trader
.

Some
traders
said
that
the
closely
watched
Major
Market
Index
,
whose

20
stocks
mimic
the
Dow
industrials
,
did
n't
lead
yesterday
's
big
rally
.

James
Gallagher
,
a
partner
at
specialist
Fowler
&
Rosenau
,
said
,
``
The
difference
between
today
and
two
years
ago
''
--
``
Terrible
Tuesday
,
''
Oct.
20
,
1987
--
``
is
that
then
we
needed
a
savior
to
go
into
the
Major
Market
Index
,
spend
$
2
million
and
get
the
program
rally
started
.

This
time
{
institutions
}
saw
the
programs
coming
and
backed
away
and
backed
away
.

Then
when
the
market
was
at
a
technical
level
to
buy
,
they
came
in
with
a
vengeance
.

''

However
,
according
to
one
analyst
,
the
timing
of
Major
Market
Index
futures
buying
just
before
the
turnaround
was
similar
to
that
of
Terrible
Tuesday
.

``
Futures
were
pulling
the
stock
market
higher
,
''
said
Donald
Selkin
,
head
of
stock-index
futures
research
at
Prudential-Bache
Securities
Inc
.

Although
the
Big
Board
's
specialist
firms
struggled
through
another
highly
volatile
trading
session
,
their
performance
yesterday
was
better
than
during
Friday
's
late-afternoon
chaos
,
according
to
traders
and
brokers

who
work
with
them
.

Specialists
were
criticized
for
their
inability
to
maintain
orderly
markets
during
the
Friday
plunge
.

But
yesterday
,
even
with
halts
in
such
major
blue-chip
stocks
as
Merck
,
``
we
expected
(
the
halts
)
and
it
was
n't
too
bad
,
''
said
Donaldson
's
Mr.
Eppel
,
who
had
been
critical
of
the
specialists
'
performance
on
Friday
.

According
to
a
Big
Board
official
,
while
many
stocks
opened
late
,
there
were
subsequent
trading
halts
in
only
three
issues
--
AMR
,
Merck
and
Valero
Energy
.

Merck
is
one
of
the
most
important
stocks
in
the
Major
Market
Index
.

No
sector
of
the
market
has
been
spared
during
the
past
two
days
'
gyrations
.

Yet
from
the
Dow
industrials
'
high
on
Oct.
9
through
Friday
's
plunge
,
relatively
good
performances
have
been
turned
in
by
real-estate
,
utilities
,
precious
metals
and
life
insurance
stocks
.

And
yesterday
,
the
top
performing
industry
group
was
oil
field
equipment
issues
.

For
example
,
Halliburton
jumped
3
to
38
,
Schlumberger
rose
2
to
43
and
Baker
Hughes
rose
1
to
22
.

Because
of
the
UAL
and
AMR
tumbles
,
airlines
were
the
weakest
sector
of
the
market
yesterday
.

Philip
Morris
was
the
Big
Board
's
most
active
issue
,
rising
2
to
43
on
nearly
eight
million
shares
.

Among
other
major
issues
,
Coca-Cola
Co.
closed
up
2
at
66
on
1.7
million
shares
and
American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
rose
3
to
43
on
nearly
7.8
million
shares
.

Shares
of
International
Business
Machines
,
which
reported
earnings
yesterday
,
finished
at
103
,
up
1
,
after
slipping
below
100
during
Friday
's
session
for
the
first
time
in
five
years
.

Shares
of
three
brokerage
firms
rose
after
they
reported
earnings
.

Merrill
Lynch
added
1
to
28
,
PaineWebber
rose
to
18
and
Bear
Stearns
rose
to
14
.

Federal
National
Mortgage
Association
,
a
recently
hot
stock
,
climbed
4
to
124
on
nearly
1.6
million
shares
.

At
a
news
conference
after
the
close
of
trading
yesterday
,
the
Big
Board
's
Mr.
Phelan
and
other
exchange
officials
praised
the
performance
of
their
computers
and
personnel
.

Mr.
Phelan
said
that
program
trading
strategies
were
n't
responsible
for
triggering
Friday
's
decline
despite
a
jump
in
the
use
of
the
computer-driven
strategies
in
recent
months
.

Some
24
million
of
the
more
than
100
million
shares
traded
in
the
final
90
minutes
of
Friday
's
session
,
when
the
plunge
in
stock
prices
was
concentrated
,
were
program-related
,
he
said
.

Program
trades
make
up
10
%
of
the
exchange
's
volume
on
an
average
day
,
but
despite
the
increase
Friday
,
it
was
``
certainly
not
something

you
would
say
precipitated
the
market
decline
,
''
Mr.
Phelan
said
.

Mr.
Phelan
expressed
relief
that
the
market
rebounded
yesterday
.

``
Obviously
,
every
time

we
get
this
kind
of
reaction
,
it
's
going
to
make
everybody
nervous
,
including
me
,
''
he
said
.

He
said
that
exchange
officials
had
conversations
with
Wall
Street
firms
throughout
the
weekend
and
that
``
all
the
participants
behaved
very
,
very
responsibly
today
.

''

Meanwhile
,
Peter
DaPuzzo
,
Shearson
's
head
of
retail
equity
trading
,
praised
institutional
investors
in
the
OTC
market
,
who
were
heavy
buyers
of
the
Nasdaq
's
biggest
technology
issues
yesterday
amid
a
flood
of
selling
by
other
investors
.

``
The
institutions
ca
n't
be
criticized
for
their
behavior
,
''
Mr.
DaPuzzo
said
in
an
interview
.

``
It
was
the
opposite
of
what
happened
on
Oct.
19
.

They
used
their
judgment
.

They
did
n't
panic
during
the
first
round
of
selling
this
morning
.

Instead
,
they
bought
on
weakness
and
sold
into
the
strength
,
which
kept
the
market
orderly
.

Maybe
they
learned
from
experience
.

''

Mr.
Phelan
said
the
performance
of
specialists
during
Friday
's
plunge
was
admirable
,
because
out
of
1,640
Big
Board
common
stocks
traded
during
the
day
only
seven
were
closed
and
were
n't
reopened
before
the
close
.

``
They
did
an
excellent
job
,
''
Mr.
Phelan
said
of
the
specialists
.

Wall
Street
traders
on
Friday
had
complained
about
the
trading
suspensions
.

.

The
closely
held

had
annual

of
close
to
$
2
billion
in
1988
,
of
which

$

Chicago
investor
William
Farley
agreed
to
sell
three
divisions
of
Cluett
Peabody
&
Co.
for
about
$
600
million
to
Bidermann
S.A.
,
a
closely
held
clothing
maker
based
in
Paris
.

Shortly
after
completing
the
$
1.56
billion
acquisition
of
West
Point-Pepperell
Inc.
in
April
,
Mr.
Farley
's
holding
company
,
Farley
Inc.
,
said
it
was
considering
the
sale
of
Cluett
,
a
leading
shirt
maker
and
one
of
West
Point-Pepperell
's
biggest
units
.

Included
in
the
sale
are
Cluett
units

that
make
men
's
shirts
under
the
Arrow
name
,
socks
under
the
Gold
Toe
name
and
menswear
through
the
Schoeneman
division
.

The
companies
said
the
agreement
is
subject
to
Bidermann
's
receipt
of
financing
and
to
regulatory
and
other
approvals
.

They
said
the
sale
is
expected
to
be
concluded
by
the
end
of
November
.

Mr.
Farley
said
the
sale
of
three
of
Cluett
's
four
main
divisions
plus
other
``
anticipated
''
West
Point-Pepperell
asset
sales
by
December
,
should
bring
in
a
total
of
about
$
700
million
.

He
did
n't
elaborate
on
other
asset
sales
being
considered
.

Mr.
Farley
followed
a
similar
pattern
when
he
acquired
Northwest
Industries
Inc.
and
then
sold
much
of
its
assets
.

But
he
kept
Fruit
of
the
Loom
Inc.
,
the
underwear
maker
that
he
still
controls
and
serves
as
chairman
and
chief
executive
.

Cluett
was
an
independent
company
until
West
Point-Pepperell
acquired
it
for
$
375
million
in
cash
and
stock
in
1986
.

In
the
fiscal
year
ended
Sept.
30
,
1988
,
Cluett
had
operating
profit
of
$
37
million
on
sales
of
$
757
million
.

Bidermann
sells
clothes
under
various
labels
,
including
Yves
Saint
Laurent
and
Bill
Robinson
for
men
and
Ralph
Lauren
for
women
.

A
spokesman
said
the
company
had
sales
of
$
400
million
in
1988
.

DD
Acquisition
Corp.
said
it
extended
its
$
45-a-share
offer
for
Dunkin
'
Donuts
Inc.
to
Nov.
1
from
yesterday
.

The
offer
has
an
indicated
value
of
$
268
million
.

DD
Acquisition
is
a
partnership
of
Unicorp
Canada
Corp.
's
Kingsbridge
Capital
Group
unit
and
Cara
Operations
Ltd
.

As
previously
reported
,
under
the
terms
of
a
confidentiality
agreement
with
Dunkin
'
Donuts
,
the
partners
agreed
to
keep
their
offer
open
until
Nov.
1
,
and
not
to
acquire
any
additional
shares
except
through
a
tender
offer
expiring
on
that
date
.

DD
Acquisition
said
that
it
already
owns
15
%
of
the
common
shares
of
the
doughnut
shop
chain
and
that
as
of
the
close
of
business
Friday

an
additional
11
%
had
been
tendered
to
its
offer
.

Dunkin
'
Donuts
is
based
in

food
services
concern

Vitro
S.A.
said
it
signed
a
definitive
agreement
to
acquire
Anchor
Glass
Container
Corp.
for
$
21.25

a
share
,
or
$
265
million
,
in
the
largest
takeover
of
an
American
company
by
a
Mexican
concern
.

Anchor
was
relatively
unaffected
by
Friday
's
market
plunge
,
perhaps
because
Vitro
was
bidding
for
the
company
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
Anchor
closed
at
$
18.375
,
down
$
1.375
.

Yesterday
's
announcement
of
the
accord
culminated
a
two-month
long
battle
for
the
Tampa
,
Fla.
,
maker
of
bottles
and
other
glass
containers
.

Anchor
had
been
fighting
Vitro
's
earlier
$
20-a-share
tender
offer
and
agreed
to
the
sweetened
bid
after
a
special
committee
of
Anchor
's
board
put
the
company
on
the
block
.

Anchor
said
previously
that
it
held
talks
with
other
parties
,
but
no
other
bids
emerged
.

Vitro
,
which
already
owns
1,430,000
Anchor
shares
,
agreed
to
buy
the
remaining
12,470,000
shares
outstanding
through
THR
Corp.
,
an
indirect
subsidiary
of
Vitro
.

The
Monterrey
,
Mexico
,
conglomerate
also
confirmed
a
previous
announcement
that
it
would
acquire
closely
held
Latchford
Glass
Co.
of
Huntington
Park
,
Calif.
,
in
a
separate
transaction
expected
to
close
at
the
same
time
as
the
completion
of
the
Anchor
takeover
.

The
purchase
price
of
the
Latchford
transaction
was
n't
disclosed
.

Vitro
said
Security
Pacific
National
Bank
committed
$
139
million
to
finance
the
purchase
of
Anchor
and
an
affiliate
of
Donaldson
,
Lufkin
&
Jenrette
Securities
Corp.
committed
$
155
million
in
a
bridge
loan
to
finance
the
Anchor
and
Latchford
acquisitions
.

Ernesto
Martens
R.
,
Vitro
's
chief
executive
officer
,
said
the
company
intends
to
keep
Anchor
based
in
Tampa
and
that
the
unit
would
be
run
independently
by
U.S.
managers
.

Mr.
Martens
called
the
takeover

a
``
unique
strategic
opportunity
''
for
Vitro
to
become
``
a
world
player
''
in
the
glass-container
industry
.

Among
other
things
,
Vitro
makes
glass
containers
,
flat
glass
and
glass-making
machinery
.

The
Supreme
Court
agreed
to
decide
whether
a
federal
court
,
in
an
antitrust
lawsuit
filed
by
state
officials
or
private
parties
,
may
dismantle
a
merger
that
it
has
ruled
anti-competitive
.

The
high
court
agreed
to
hear
the
state
of
California
's
challenge
to
the
legality
of
the
acquisition
of
Lucky
Stores
Inc.
,
a
supermarket
chain
,
by
American
Stores
Co.

which
owns
another
chain
,
Alpha
Beta
Stores
Inc
.

Under
federal
antitrust
law
,
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
and
the
Justice
Department
have
the
authority
to
ask
a
federal
court
to
order
the
divestiture
of
a
merger

that
has
been
completed
but
has
been
found
to
be
anticompetitive
.

But
even
after
the
federal
agencies
have
approved
a
merger
,
federal
antitrust
law
allows
states
or
other
affected
parties
to
sue
to
challenge
the
merger
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
anticompetitive
.

Federal
appeals
courts
,
however
,
disagree
whether
federal
courts
have
the
authority
to
order
the
break
up
of
completed
mergers
in
such
private
antitrust
lawsuits
.

While
the
high
court
tries
to
resolve
the
disparate
views
of
the
appeals
courts
,
American
Stores
remains
under
a
temporary
order
to
operate
the
two
supermarket
chains
as
separate
businesses
.

American
Stores
'
bid
for
Lucky
Stores
began
as
a
hostile
offer
.

But
when
the
tender
offer
was
increased
,
Lucky
's
directors
approved
the
merger
and
,
in
June
1988
,
American
Stores
'
$
2.5
billion
purchase
of
Lucky
Stores
was
completed
.

The
FTC
reviewed
the
merger
and
,
in
August
1988
,
approved
a
settlement
between
the
FTC
staff
and
American
Stores
.

While
the
settlement
was
under
review
by
the
FTC
,
the
staff
required
American
Stores
to
run
the
Lucky
and
Alpha
Beta
chains
separately
.

Meanwhile
,
California
officials
,
arguing
that
the
merger
would
cost
the
state
's
consumers
$
400
million
annually
in
higher
prices
,
sued
in
federal
court
in
September
1988
.

A
federal
judge
in
Los
Angeles
,
after
a
hearing
but
before
a
trial
was
held
,
reached
an
initial
conclusion
that
the
merger
was
anti-competitive
.

He
then
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
ordering
American
Stores
to
continue
to
run
the
two
chains
separately
.

A
federal
appeals
court
in
San
Francisco
ruled
in
March
that
the
district
court
's
order
had
the
same
effect
as
requiring
divestiture
of
one
chain
by
American
Stores
.

The
appeals
court
said
federal
courts
lack
the
authority
to
require
divestiture
in
private
antitrust
lawsuits
.

In
August
,
Supreme
Court
Justice
Sandra
O'Connor
issued
a
temporary
stay
,
requiring
the
separate
operations
to
continue
until
the
high
court
could
decide
whether
to
hear
the
case
.

Right-to-Die
Appeal

The
Bush
administration
,
in
a
friend-of-the-court
brief
,
said
that
the
Constitution
gives
states
broad
flexibility
to
require
that
medical
patients
in
permanent
,
vegetative
conditions
continue
to
receive
artificial
feeding
and
fluids
.

The
brief
,
filed
by
Solicitor
General
Kenneth
Starr
,
said
the
family
of
a
Missouri
woman
in
such
a
vegetative
state
does
n't
have
the
constitutional
right
to
insist
the
state
cut
off
artificial
feeding
.

The
brief
makes
roughly
the
same
argument

the
government
made
last
week
in
a
brief
urging
more
leeway
for
states
to
restrict
abortions
.

The
brief
filed
yesterday
says
state
regulations
need
only
be
``
reasonable
''
to
withstand
federal
court
review
,
an
easy
standard
for
states
to
satisfy
.

Moreover
,
the
brief
is
critical
of
arguments
for
a
constitutional
right
to
privacy
,
saying
any
right
for
competent
individuals
to
refuse
medical
treatment
should
be
rooted
in
tradition
and
based
on
the
14th
Amendment
``
due
process
''
protection
of
``
liberty
,
''
not
on
``
abstract
notions
''
of
privacy
,
which

the
Constitution
does
n't
mention
.

Abortion
Case

Organizations
supporting
the
constitutional
right
to
abortion
filed
a
friend-of-the-court
brief
in
two
Supreme
Court
cases
in
behalf
of
an
unprecedented
number
of
groups
.

The
brief
,
coordinated
by
the
American
Civil
Liberties
Union
and
Planned
Parenthood
Federation
of
America
,
was
filed
in
behalf
of
274
groups
,
although
many
of
them
were
small
community
religious
organizations
rather
than
national
in
membership
.

The
brief
argued
that
the
1973
decision
recognizing
the
right
to
abortion
,
Roe
vs.
Wade
,
was
correct
and
should
n't
be
reconsidered
.

BSN
Corp.
said
it
will
begin
an
offer
tomorrow
to
exchange
up
to
one
million
of
its
common
shares
and
all
of
its
$
16.6
million
in
7
%
convertible
debentures
due
2001
for
a
package
of
new
debt
and
common
stock
warrants
.

Under
terms
of
the
offer
,
the
sporting
goods
maker
will
swap
$
9
face
amount
of
9
%
subordinated
notes
due
1996
and
one
warrant
for
each
common
share
.

Each
warrant
allows
the
holder
to
buy
one
BSN
share
for
$
10.75

a
share
at
any
time
over
the
next
seven
years
.

BSN
currently
has
4.6
million
common
shares
outstanding
.

BSN
also
is
offering
$
850
face
amount
of
new
notes
and
64
common-stock
warrants
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
of
its
convertible
debt
outstanding
.

The
company
said
it
can
redeem
the
warrants
at
its
option
for
$
1
each
.

The
offer
is
n't
contingent
on
a
certain
amount
of
debt
or
stock
being
exchanged
.

BSN
said
it
is
making
the
offer
to
shrink
its
capital
and
increase
shareholder
value
.

If
all
the
bondholders
and
holders
of
one
million
common
shares
accept
the
offer
,
BSN
will
increase
its
debt
by
$
9
million
,
but
it
also
will
recognize
a
$
2
million
gain
from
retiring
the
old
debt
,
said
Michael
J.
Blumenfeld
,
president
.

``
We
have
sufficient
cash
flow
to
handle
that
,
''
he
said
.

The
offers
are
scheduled
to
expire
in
mid
to
late
November
.

The
market
upheaval
apparently
has
n't
triggered
any
cash
crunch
--
yet
.

Individual
investors
,
investment
firms
and
arbitragers

who
speculate
in
the
stocks
of
takeover
candidates
can
suffer
liquidity
and
payment
problems
when
stocks
dive
;
those
investors
often
borrow
heavily
to
buy
their
holdings
and
use
the
stocks
as
collateral
for
loans
.

But
several
large
banks
said
yesterday
they
detected
no
signs
of
unusual
demand
for
credit

that
would
signal
such
difficulties
.

``
We
're
seeing
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
,
''
said
one
official
at
a
Top
10
bank
.

``
That
's
good
news
,
because
we

all
swim
in
this
water
.

''
Added
another
executive
at
a
big
bank
:
``
We
were
all
a
little
goosey
over
the
weekend
trying
to
forecast
what
would
happen
{
Monday
}
,
but
it
's
been
very
quiet
.

Now
,
as
for
tomorrow
,
hell
,
who
knows
?

''


What
happened
Friday
shows
that
financial
markets
are
not
yet
sufficiently
coordinated
to
handle
another
meltdown
in
prices
.

No
fiddling
with
systems
and
procedures
will
ever
prevent
markets
from
suffering
a
panic
wave
of
selling
.

But
markets
can
operate
with
greater
or
lesser
efficiency
.

After
the
1987
plunge
,
markets
agreed
that
it
would
be
wise
to
halt
trading
whenever
panic
conditions
arose
.

The
New
York
Stock
Exchange
adopted
two
specific
circuit
breakers
:
If
the
Dow
Jones
index
falls
250
points
in
a
day
,
the
exchange
will
halt
trading
for
one
hour
;
if
the
decline
hits
400
points
,
the
exchange
will
close
for
an
additional
two
hours
.

The
rationale
is
that
an
interruption
of
trading
will
allow
investors
to
reconsider
their
strategies
,
calm
sellers
and
lead
buyers
to
enter
the
market
at
indicated
new
price
levels
.

It
is
impossible
to
know
whether
that
theory
is
realistic
.

A
temporary
cessation
of
trading
may
indeed
discourage
a
selling
panic
from
feeding
on
itself
.

But
there
is
also
the
possibility
that
shutting
down
markets
will
intensify
fears
and
cause
an
even

more
abrupt
slide
in
prices
.

What
happened
Friday
was
the
worst
of
all
worlds
.

The
futures
exchanges
followed
their
own
pre-set
circuit
breakers
and
shut
down
at
about
3
p.m.
for
30
minutes
,
after
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
stock
index
had
fallen
12
points
,
or
about
100
points
on
the
Dow
Jones
index
.

Options
markets
stopped
trading
in
many
securities
.

The
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
under
its
own
rules
,
remained
open
.

With
nowhere
else
to
go
,
sellers
,
and
particularly
program
traders
,
focused
all
their
selling
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

As
liquidity
on
that
market
weakened
,
prices
fell
sharply
.

Had
the
futures
and
options
markets
been
open
,
additional
liquidity
would
have
been
provided
and
the
decline
,
most
probably
,
would
have
been
less
intense
.

At
3:30
,
after
intense
telephone
negotiations
between
the
trading
markets
and
Washington
,
the
futures
exchanges
reopened
.

Futures
trading
,
however
,
was
halted
altogether
at
3:45
,
after
the
futures
markets
had
dropped
an
additional
30
points
,
which
is
the
daily
limit
for
price
declines
.

At
this
point
,
the
options
markets
also
shut
down
and
once
more
left
all
sales
to
be
handled
by
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

It
is
time
to
recognize
that
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
the
futures
markets
and
the
options
markets
,
though
physically
separate
,
have
actually
become
so
closely
intertwined
as
to
constitute
one
market
effectively
.

Traders
can
vary
their
strategies
and
execute
their
orders
in
any

one
of
them
.

It
therefore
makes
no
sense
for
each
market
to
adopt
different
circuit
breakers
.

To
achieve
maximum
liquidity
and
minimize
price
volatility
,
either
all
markets
should
be
open
to
trading
or
none
.

Synchronized
circuit
breakers
would
not
have
halted
the
slide
in
prices
on
Friday
,
but
they
probably
would
have
made
for
smoother
,
less
volatile
executions
.

It

's
time
for
the
exchanges
and
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
to
agree
on
joint
conditions
for
halting
trading
or
staying
open
.

Let
's
not
have
one
market
shut
down
for
30
minutes
when
the
Dow
declines
100
points
and
another
shut
down
for
an
hour
after
a
250-point
decline
.

The
need
for
hurried
last-minute
telephone
negotiations
among
market
officials
will
disappear
once
rules
are
in
place

that
synchronize
circuit
breakers
in
all
markets
.

The
new
circuit
breakers
,
if
they
are
to
be
applied
at
all
,
will
require
that
futures
and
options
trading
continue
as
long
as
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
remains
open
.

The
rules
should
be
established
by
agreement
of
the
officials
of
all
affected
exchanges
acting
under
the
oversight
and
with
the
approval
of
the
government
regulatory
agencies
.

Should
the
SEC
and
the
Commodities
Futures
Trading
Commission
(
which
,
with
the
SEC
,
regulates
the
Chicago
stock-index
markets

)
be
unable
to
agree
,
the
issue
may
have
to
be
resolved
by
decision
of
the
Treasury
secretary
.

In
many
ways
,
our
financial
markets
are
better
prepared
today
to
handle
a
decline
than
they
were
two
years
ago
.

The
New
York
Stock
Exchange
now
has
the
capacity
to
handle
a
volume
of
nearly
a
billion
shares

a
day
.

Telephone
service
has
been
improved
for
customers
trying
to
reach
their
brokers
,
and
specialists
--
who

I
believe
should
stay
,
despite
the
urgings
of
some
post-crash
critics
--
have
larger
capital
positions
.

(
Of
course
,
specialists
'
actions
alone
can
never
prevent
a
major
crack
in
stock
prices
.

Witness
the
fact
that
trading
in
some
stocks
closed
early
Friday
and
opened
late
Monday
because
of
an
excess
of
sell
orders
.

)
But
the
task
of
improving
market
performance
remains
unfinished
.

Mr.
Freund

A
group
of
institutional
investors
in
Telerate
Inc.
said
that
Dow
Jones
&
Co.
's
$
18-a-share
offer
for
the
electronic
financial
information
services
company
is
``
grossly
inadequate

''

In
a

filed
with
the
Securities

Exchange
Commission
,
the
group
,
which
holds
about
4.5
million
Telerate
shares
,
or
about
4.7
%
of
the
shares
outstanding
,
said
``
...
at
present

none
of
us
believes
an
offer
for
less
than
$
25
per

would
be
fair
and
some
believe
that
$
25
is
too
low
.

''
The
letter
was
dated
Oct.
6
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
Telerate
shares
closed
yesterday
at
$
18.875
,
down
75
cents

a
share
.

Dow
Jones
,
publisher
of
The
Wall
Street
Journal
,
has
launched
an
$
18-a-share
,
or
$
576
million
,
tender
offer
to
acquire
the
remaining
Telerate
shares
outstanding
;
Dow
Jones
owns
67
%
of
Telerate
.

Telerate
has
rejected
the
offer
,
which
expires
Nov.
3
.

The
group
includes
Putnam

and
various
affiliates
based
in
Boston
;
Wells

,

;
the
California

and

Among
other
issues
,
the
group
's
letter
said
it
has
``
concerns
as
to
whether
Dow
Jones
's
offer
meets
the
applicable
requirements
of
procedural
fairness
.

''

A
spokesman
for
Dow

said
he
had
n't
seen
the

's
filing
,
but
added
,
``
obviously
Dow

The
continuing
series
of
HUD
scandals
is
a
sadly
predictable
result
of
pork-barrel
politics
.

Nevertheless
,
lobbies
such
as
the
National
Association
of
Home
Builders
(
NAHB
)
continue
to
pressure
Capitol
Hill
for
more
special-interest
spending
.

Kent
Colton
,
NAHB
executive
vice
president
,
argues
that
the
U.S.
faces
a
multifaceted
housing
crisis
--
reduced
affordability
of
homes
for
first-time
buyers
,
increased
homelessness
,
and
lower
apartment
construction
rates
--
that
will
be
``
very
difficult
''
to
solve
``
without
expanded
federal
resources
.

''

There
's
nothing
unusual
about
business
groups
pushing
for
more
government
spending
.

But
the
NAHB
was
created
in
1943
out
of
an
organization

that
made
its
name
fighting
a
Roosevelt
administration
proposal
to
take
over
all
defense
housing
production
.

Through
the
years

the
association
has
been
an
active
member
of
the
taxpayer
's
coalition
,
pushing
for
such
initiatives
as
the
balanced-budget
amendment
.

Yet
on
matters
close
to
,
er
,
home
...

``
The
HUD
budget
has
dropped
by
more
than
70
%
since
1980
,
''
argues
Mr.
Colton
.

``
We
've
taken
more
than
our
fair
share
.

I
would
n't
have
a
problem
if
other
programs
had
taken
a
similar
hit
.

''

But
NAHB
support
for
subsidies
is
not
related
to
the
current
housing
crunch
;
over
the
years

the
NAHB
has
backed
a
host
of
public
programs
.

It
once
pushed
for
a
national
housing
production
goal
set
by
the
federal
government
and
has
regularly
advanced
anti-recession
housing
measures
.

Moreover
,
explains
one
HUD
official
,
the
NAHB
remains
susceptible
to
internal
pressure
from
members

that
specialize
in
subsidized
production
.

The
association
is
pushing
an
extensive
and
expensive
wish-list
,
which
would
substantially
boost
spending
above
the
current
level
of
more
than
$
15
billion
annually
.

It
would
like
to
peg
the
ceiling
on
Federal
Housing
Administration
mortgage
guarantees
to
95
%
of
the
median
price
in
a
particular
market
,
instead
of
limiting
it
to
$
101,250
;
reduce
(
or
even
eliminate
)
FHA
down-payment
requirements
and
increase
the
availability
of
variable-rate
mortgages
;
expand
the
Veterans
Affairs
Department
loan
guarantee
program
;
provide
``
adequate
''
funding
for
the
Farmers
Home
Administration
(
FmHA
)
;
increase
federal
funding
and
tax
incentives
for
the
construction
of
low-income
and
rental
housing
,
including
$
4
billion
in
block
grants
to
states
and
localities
;
and
``
fully
fund
''
the
McKinney
Act
,
a
$
656
million
potpourri
for
the
homeless
.

Direct
federal
subsidies
for
housing
construction
have
proved
intolerably
expensive
in
the
past
,
and
inevitably
are
twisted
to
the
benefit
of
well-connected
developers
and
lobbyists
,
as
demonstrated
by
the
ongoing
HUD
scandal
,
or
congressmen
.

Indirect
subsidies
,
through
the
FHA
,
for
instance
,
are
little
better
.

Though
Mr.
Colton
says
expanding
FHA
lending
would
result
in
``
no
cost
to
the
government
,
''
the
mere
diversion
of
funds
from
other
parts
of
the
economy
and
from
other
forms
of
housing
(
such
as
low-income
)
to
the
single-family
home
market
would
result
in
a
major
expense
.

More
important
,
housing
programs
run
by
HUD
,
the
VA
,
and
FmHA
are
awash
in
red
ink
.

The
FHA
alone
lost
$
4.2
billion
in
fiscal
1988
;
the
government
's
equity
in
the
agency
,
essentially
its
reserve
fund
,
fell
to
minus
$
2.9
billion
.

The
federal
government
has
had
to
pump
in
$
2.28
billion
into
the
VA
housing
program
since
1984
to
keep
the
fund
afloat
and
the
VA
requested
an
additional
$
120
million
for
the
fiscal
year
just
ended
.

All
told
,
the
federal
government
already
guarantees
more
than
$
900
billion
of
mortgages
.

In
its
nicely
produced
publication
``
Where
Will
Our
Children
Live
?
''
the
NAHB
does
acknowledge
that
``
of
course
,
the
full
measure
of
housing
affordability
can
not
be
provided
by
the
federal
government
.

''
It
points
to
the
pernicious
impact
of
local
government
regulation
,
particularly
zoning
and
building
fees
,
which
pushes
the
price
of
housing
out
of
the
reach
of
low-
and
middle-income
people
.

But
while
the
NAHB
has
suggested
actions
that
states
and
localities
should
take
to
reduce
regulatory
barriers
,
the
association
has
proposed
no
activist
legislative
program
--
comparable
to
,
say
,
its
detailed
request
for
more
federal
subsidies
--
to
eliminate
counterproductive
controls
.

The
association
,
a
majority
of
whose

156,000
members
build
fewer
than
25
units

a
year
,
is
like
many
other
business
lobbies
.

Explains
Sheila
MacDonald
of
the
National
Taxpayers
Union
:
``
It
treads
in
two
worlds
.

The
builders
like
the
subsidies
,
but
at
the
same
time

they
tend
to
be
fiscal
conservatives
in
terms
of
major
issues
,
such
as
the
balanced-budget
amendment
.

''
Unfortunately
,
the
organization
's
desire
for
pork
tends
to
override
its
commitment
to
overall
fiscal
responsibility
.

Two
years
ago
when
the
NAHB
lobbied
for
the
$
19
billion
omnibus
housing
bill
,
the
organization
``
basically
dropped
out
of
the
taxpayers
'
coalition
,
''
says
Ms.
MacDonald
.

As
Mr.
Colton
of
the
NAHB
acknowledges
:
``
Government
is
not
going
to
solve
the
problem
...
.

The
real
key
is
to
have
the
economy
working
and
interest
rates
down
.

''
More
money
for
HUD
will
increase
the
deficit
and
destabilize
the
economy
;
more
money
to
municipalities

that
are
wrecking
their
local
housing
markets
will
further
insulate
them
from
the
destructive
effects
of
their
policies
.

Is
this
what

the
home
builders
want
?

``
Circuit-breaker
''
trading
halts
on
this
city
's
futures
and
options
exchanges
may
have
speeded
the
stock
market
's
fall
on
Friday
.

Stock-index
futures
trading
on
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
and
stock-index
options
trading
on
the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
initially
closed
within
a
few
minutes
of
each
other
Friday
afternoon
.

But
trading
in
the
nation
's
most
active
stock-index
option
on
the
CBOE
did
n't
reopen
for
the
day
.

As
a
result
,
options
traders
were
forced
to
sell
elsewhere
,
driving
futures
and
stock
prices
lower
,
traders
said
.

And
when
trading
in
the
Chicago
Merc
's
stock-index
futures
had
finally
halted
for
the
day
as
well
,
sell
orders
cascaded
onto
the
floor
of
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
adding
to
the
rout
.

What
's
more
,
in
anticipation
of
the
trading
halts
many
traders
--
worried
about
being
unable
to
trade
at
lower
prices
--
sold
futures
and
options
contracts
,
thereby
knocking
prices
still
lower
.

The
wildly
fluctuating
markets
appeared
to
have
claimed
at
least
one
victim
.

Fossett
Corp.
,
an
options-trading
firm
,
said
last
night
that
it
is
transferring
all
of
its
customer
accounts
to
First
Options
of
Chicago
.

Stephen
Fossett
,
president
and
sole
owner
of
the
company
,
said
that
he
was
making
the
transfers
as
a
result
of
a
substantial
cash
squeeze
stemming
from
numerous
calls
for
cash
and
margin
money
on
Friday
by
several
stock-option
and
futures
exchanges
.

``
All
of
our
obligations
were
met
,
''
Mr.
Fossett
said
.

Although
few
other
trading
firms
here
or
in
New
York
appeared
to
be
in
immediate
financial
difficulty
,
Friday
's
volatility
also
underscored
the
need
for
exchanges
in
Chicago
to
hasten
the
common
clearing
of
futures
and
options
contracts
,
traders
said
.

``
I
'm
very
disappointed
.

The
trading
halts
in
futures
and
options
may
have
done
more
harm
than
good
,
''
said
Jeffrey
Tabak
,
a
partner
in
the
investment
firm
of
Miller
Tabak
Hirsch
&
Co.
,
and
a
member
of
the
presidential
commission

that
recommended
intermarket
circuit
breakers
be
adopted
.

The
situation
``
is
clearly
uncorrected
,
''
said
Glenn
W.
Clark
,
a
Washington
,
D.C.
,
author
on
the
futures
markets
.

``
All
{
a
trading
halt
}
does
is
smooth
the
movement
.

''

The
stock-index
futures
and
options
also
are
likely
to
weigh
heavily
on
the
stock
market

this
morning
.

The
S&P
500
index
future

that
expires
in
December
closed
at
328.85
,
nearly
five
index
points
below
the
333.65
closing
price
of
the
S&P
500
index

itself
,
which
is
based
on
the
value
of
the
500
stocks
in
the
index
.

The
wide
discount
of
the
index
futures
price
against
the
actual
index
may
tempt
program
traders
,
who
profit
from
price
discrepancies
between
stocks
and
futures
,
to
buy
the
relatively
cheap
futures
and
sell
stocks
,
sending
the
stock
market
still
lower
.

That
selling
could
pull
futures
prices
lower
as
well
,
triggering
another
round
of
program
selling
.

Traders
emphasized
,
however
,
that
the
price
relationship
between
stocks
and
futures
could
change
substantially
by
this
morning
's
start
of
trading
,
based
on
trading
overnight
in
Japan
,
an
influx
of
new
orders
or
other
events
.

Trading
first
halted
in
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
futures
contract
on
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
at
2:07
p.m.
CST
,
after
the
contract
had
fallen
12
index
points
.

It
reopened
at
2:30
p.m.
,
but
traded
freely
for
only
15
minutes
before
hitting
its
daily
limit
of
30
points
below
the
previous
day
's
close
.

Sporadic
trading
occurred
at
that
level
for
the
next
half-hour
until
the
contract
's
normal
closing
time
of
3:15
p.m
.

The
trading
halts
'
main
effect
,
as
designed
,
was
to
permit
the
stock
market
to
catch
up
with
the
futures
markets
.

When
the
Merc
imposed
its
first
halt
in
the
S&P
500
futures
contract
after
the
12-point
drop
,
the
stock
index
on
which

the
contract
is
based
went
down
from
eight
points
to
13
points
,
roughly
in
line
with
the
futures
contract
.

But
conflicting
steps
by
some
Chicago
exchanges
caused
consternation
among
traders
.

Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
officials
,
for
instance
,
halted
trading
in
their
S&P
100-stock
index
option
contract
,
as
expected
,
shortly
after
the
Merc
imposed
its
initial
trading
halt
.

The
CBOE
decided
not
to
reopen
the
nation
's
largest
stock-index
option
market
after
the
S&P
500
index
contract
reopened
and
halted
again
a
short
time
later
.

The
CBOE
said
in
a
statement
that
``
the
interests
of
fair
and
orderly
markets
would
n't
be
served
by
a
resumption
of
trading
.

''
But
some
options
traders
said
they
were
furious
that
they
had
been
denied
a
chance
to
trade
while
other
markets
were
open
.

The
CBOE
action
also
may
have
driven
prices
lower
in
the
Chicago
Merc
's
huge
S&P
500
index
futures
pit
,
traders
said
.

As
much
as
25
%
of
the
volume
in
S&P
500
futures
on
most
days
comes
from
CBOE
traders
hedging
their
risks
in
the
options
markets
.

With
their
own
market
closed
late
Friday
,
some
options
traders
deluged
the
S&P
500
futures
pit
with
sell
orders
to
hedge
their
frozen
options
positions
,
traders
said
.

As
a
result
,
one
of
the
largest
options-trading
firms
in
the
country
offered
to
sell
1,000
S&P
500
contracts
at
the
limit
of
30
index
points
below
the
previous
day
's
close
,
an
S&P
500
futures
trader
said
.

That
offer
and
others
like
it
killed
any
chance
of
a
late
rally
and
drove
down
stock-index
futures
prices
to
the
daily
limit
,
the
trader
added
.

With
the
Chicago
markets
closed
,
traders
were
left
with
no
choice
but
to
``
bang
the
bids
{
sell
stocks
}
in
New
York
,
''
Mr.
Tabak
said
.

The
Major
Market
Index
futures
contract
on
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
,
traded
much
less
actively
,
touched
its
daily
limit
of
50
points
below
the
previous
day
's
close
several
times
Friday
,
but
bounced
back
slightly
and
never
halted
trading
.

To
provide
an
added
cash
cushion
to
compensate
for
the
increased
price
volatility
in
their
markets
,
the
Chicago
Merc
required
traders
to
increase
the
margin
,
or
amount
of
cash

they
put
up
to
trade
S&P
500
contracts
,
by
one-third
to
$
12,000

a
contract
from
$
9,000
,
effective

this
morning
.

The
Board
of
Trade
doubled
margin
requirements
for
the
Major
Market
Index
futures
to
$
8,000

a
contract
.

Officials
of
the
exchanges
said
they
communicated
well
with
each
other
and
with
government
regulators
during
Fri
day
's
sell-off
,
compared
with
the
sense
of
chaos

that
prevailed
at
times
on
Black
Monday
two
years
ago
.

But
while
top
offi
cials
are
talking
,
the
exchange
's
clearing
arms
are
still
largely
in
the
dark
about
the
financial
risks
their
members
may
be
exposed
to
in
other
markets
.

The
Chicago
Merc
has
begun
limited
cross-margining
of
stock-index
futures
accounts
with
the
Options
Clearing
Corp.
,
which
processes
all
options
trades
for
U.S.
exchanges
.

But
for
the
most
part
,
stock
,
options
and
futures
markets
still
each
have
different
clearing
and
margin
systems
.

That
means
that
brokers
and
institutions
trading
on
several
exchanges
face
different
cash
requirements
on
each
,
making
it
extremely
difficult
during
a
crisis
for
an
exchange
to
ascertain
a
firm
's
overall
,
or
net
,
financial
position
.

Just
such
a
cash
squeeze
two
years
ago
,
at
a
leading
Wall
Street
firm

that
was
facing
duplicate
margin
calls
for
futures
and
options
positions
,
led
several
studies
of
the
markets
to
call
for
the
coordinated
margining
of
positions
in
different
markets
.

,
or
are
rumored
to
be
,
takeover
targets
.

INDEX
ARBITRAGE
:
The
simultaneous
trading
in
stock-index
markets
and
the
underlying

's
account
falls

a
stock
exchange
or
firm

PORTFOLIO
INSURANCE
:

STOCK-INDEX
FUTURES
:
Contracts
for
future
delivery
of
an
amount
of
cash
based
on
an
index
of
stock
prices
,
such
as
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
index
or
the
Major
Market
Index
.

A
trader
buying
a
December
S&P
500
stock-index
futures
contract
at
a
price
of
$
200
today
,
for
instance
,
would
be
agreeing
to
take
delivery
next
month
of
500
times

that
amount
in
cash
,
or
$
100,000
.

Traders
would
almost
always
close
out
that
position
by
selling
an
offsetting
futures
contract
.

If
the
stock
market
--
and
correspondingly
the
stock
index
--
rose
before
the
trader
closed
out
his
position
,
he
would
make
a
profit
because
he
could
sell
an
offsetting
contract
at
a
higher
price
,
taking
in
more
money
than
he
had
to
spend
.

If
the
market
fell
,
the
trader
would
lose
money
because
he
would
have
to
sell
an
offsetting
contract
at
a
lower
price
.

Futures

After
a
long
day
tending
the
searing
,
blackened
furnaces
of
the
Panzhihua
Iron
&
Steel
Co.
,
Li
Wankui
would
like
to
relax
away
from
the
factory
.

But
in
these
parts
,
the
factory
is
everywhere
.

It
is
employer
,
political
czar
and
dance-committee
chairman
.

Inside
the
sprawling
compounds
that
house
55,000
workers
and
their
families
,
the
factory
operates
the
schools
,
restaurants
,
hospital
and
activities
center
.

The
factory
sells
Mr.
Li
his
food
and
furniture
and
publishes
his
newspaper
.

It
even
restricts
him
and
his
wife
to
one
child
.

Sitting
at
home
with
his
family
around
the
dining
table
,
Mr.
Li
turns
on
the
evening
news
.

``
This
is
the
Panzhihua
Factory
broadcasting
station
,
''
a
perky
anchorwoman
says
.

``
And
here
's
what
happened
today
at
our
factory
.

''

Panzhihua
is
the
ultimate
company
town
.

Nestled
in
the
remote
mountains
of
southern
Sichuan
province
about
1,200
miles
southwest
of
Beijing
,
it
is
virtually
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
China
.

With
few
businesses
nearby
,
it
's
up
to
factory
leaders
to
build
high-rise
housing
and
organize
sports
meets
.

They
truck
in
fresh
fish
from
the
east
coast
and
import
television
sets
from
Japan
.

``
A
Chinese
factory
director
could
be
a
mayor
in
the
U.S.
,
''
says
Mr.
Li
.

``
But
I
do
n't
think
an
American
mayor
could
handle
a
Chinese
factory
.

''

Despite
a
decade-long
attempt
to
revamp
the
socialist
economy
,
China
's
mega-welfare
state
is
alive
and
well
.

Health
care
is
free
,
housing
costs
just
pennies
and
food
is
heavily
subsidized
.

At
Panzhihua
,
as
in
other
big
state-run
factories
,
workers
still
can
count
on
a
cradle-to-grave
safety
net
.

Factory
officials
estimate
that
more
than
10
%
of
the
work
force
here
is
redundant
,
but
layoffs
are
n't
allowed
.

Even
factory
workers
'
children
are
guaranteed
jobs
.

The
industrial
monoliths
are
so
deeply
involved
in
the
welfare
system
that
China
's
leaders
may
never
be
able
to
modernize
them
,
despite
their
glaring
economic
inefficiency
.

Though

the
Panzhihua
factory

itself
is
profitable
,
many
such
enterprises
are
n't
.

Subsidies
for
money-losing
enterprises
totaled
$
18
billion
last
year
,
or
about
one-third

the
total
state
revenue
.

Life
in
the
Panzhihua
factory
beats
a
regular
rhythm
,
and
fully
absorbs
workers
such
as
Mr.
Li
.

A
muscular
38-year-old
,
he
rises
each
morning
at
6
a.m.
to
prepare
for
his
shift
.

(
He
is
entitled
to
one
day
off
after
each
seven
days
of
work
.

)

Throwing
on
sweat
pants
and
a
T-shirt
,
he
pops
downstairs
to
a
food
shop
,
one
of
dozens
run
by
the
factory
in
Panzhihua
's
residential
area
.

Mr.
Li
,
whose
pay
is
the
equivalent
of
about
$
80

a
month
,
buys
steamed
buns
and
rice
porridge
for
his
family
.

Breakfast
for
three
costs

a
quarter
.

After
eating
,
he
heads
to
the
factory
.

Panzhihua
provides
free
bus
service
,
but
he
prefers
the
20-minute
walk
.

At
the
gate
of
the
factory
,
a
huge
sign
greets
Mr.
Li
and
his
co-workers
:
``
Happily
,
happily
come
to
work
!

''

Donning
denims
and
a
hard
hat
,
he
heads
to
the
steel-making
furnace
.

Since
the
temperature
next
to
it
can
reach
540
degrees
Fahrenheit
,
Panzhihua
Iron
&
Steel
provides
workers
as
many
free
orange-flavored
soft
drinks
as
they
want
.

The
factory
produces
the
drinks
in-house
.

At
lunchtime
,
Mr.
Li
walks
to
one
of
the
59
cafeterias

the
factory
operates
.

It
's
a
chaotic
scene
.

Scraps
of
meat
and
bones
litter
the
bare
concrete
floor
.

A
slop-bucket
at
the
doorway
is
filled
with
a
liquid
turned
blood-red
from
Sichuan
peppers
and
hot
sauce
.

The
place
does
n't
look
like
much
,
but
the
food
is
good
,
and
cheap
.

For
about
30
cents
,
Mr.
Li
buys
a
bowl
of
pork
,
vegetables
and
rice
.

At
the
end
of
Mr.
Li
's
workday
,
as
a
new
shift
prepares
to
take
over
,
the
factory
's
propaganda
officials
go
to
work
.

For
half
an
hour

they
relate
to
groups
of
workers

the
latest
news
and
views
from
the
Communist
Party
.

They
read
speeches
from
top
leaders
and
slam
U.S.
sanctions
on
China
imposed
after
the
June
4
massacre
of
pro-democracy
protesters
in
Beijing
.

``
We
want
to
make
sure
that
workers
have
a
correct
opinion
about
events
,
''
says
Yuan
Changyong
,
the
local
Party
chief
.

The
propagandists
also
do
their
part
in
the
national
effort
to
limit
births
.

Teams
of
officials
track
the
contraceptive
methods
their
workers
employ
and
even
chart
menstrual
cycles
of
female
employees
.

They
work
by
persuasion
and
coercion
,
alternating
doses
of
propaganda
with
threats
of
financial
penalties
for
``
unplanned
''
second
births
.

Zhang
Shanyun
,
one
of
Mr.
Li
's
bosses
,
knows
the
system
well
.

Like
many
married
workers
,
Mr.
Zhang
lives
alone
at
the
factory
.

His
wife
remains
in
the
countryside
,
tending
the
farm
land

they
possess
.

Whenever
Mr.
Zhang
wants
to
return
to
his
farm
,
he
must
fill
out
a
form
detailing
what
kind
of
birth-control
device

he
and
his
wife
will
use
.

The
document
must
be
certified
by
factory
officials
and
shown
to
leaders
in
his
wife
's
village
.

``
No
document
,
no
visit
,
''
smiles
Li
Jihong
,
who
heads
birth-control
efforts
at
the
factory
.

Mr.
Li
,
however
,
is
able
to
live
with
his
wife
full-time
.

When
he
returns
home
,
he
ties
on
an
apron
and
begins
to
prepare
dinner
for
his
family
.

Most
of
the
food
comes
to
him
via
the
factory
,
which
buys
80
million
tons
of
produce
a
year
.

The
factory
sells
to
workers
at
cost
,
which
means
prices
are
about
50
%
below
what

the
handful
of
independent
local
merchants
charge
.

For
big
occasions
,
the
factory
brings
in
special
treats
.

Earlier
this
year
,
officials
shipped
in
fresh
crabs
from
Guangdong
province
.

It
turned
out
that
few
workers
here
in
the
hills
of
Sichuan
had
ever
seen
them
,
so
the
factory
TV
station
ran
a
broadcast
on
the
correct
way
to
eat
Guangdong
crabs
.

The
Li
family
home
is
a
simple
,
two-room
apartment
with
bare
concrete
floors
and
whitewashed
walls
.

The
basic
furniture
is
provided
by
the
factory
,
for
five
cents

a
month
.

Most
workers
get
a
bed
,
desk
and
bureau
.

Engineers
also
get
a
bookcase
.

Mr.
Li
's
wife
,
Xia
Huaqiong
,
also
works
at
the
factory
,
tending
the
water
meters
during
the
graveyard
shift
.

There
are
few
prospects
for
upward
mobility
,
and
Mr.
Li
's
daughter
,
seven-year-old
Li
Shu
,
is
certain
to
toil
at
the
factory
too
someday
,
as
are
more
than
10,000
of
the
workers
'
children
.

Li
Shu
is
in
the
second
grade
at
the
Xiangyang
Village
Elementary
School
for
Workers
'
Children
,
one
of
31
schools
subsidized
by
the
factory
at
a
cost
of
more
than
half
a
million
dollars

a
year
.

Her
tuition
is
about
$
1

a
semester
.

Mr.
Li
says
he
is
content
living
in
this
one-company
town
.

But
he
concedes
that
the
pressures
of
the
all-powerful
factory
sometimes
are
tough
to
bear
.

He
could
do
with
more
excitement
,
he
says
.

Most
evenings
after
the
news
,
he
leaves
his
wife
in
front
of
the
TV
set
and
wanders
restlessly
around
his
quiet
neighborhood
.

He
pauses
frequently
to
greet
familiar
faces
:
co-workers
from
the
factory
.

Inevitably
,
he
is
drawn
to
the
Cultural
Center
,
a
drab
,
five-story
structure
with
meeting
rooms
,
stores
,
coffee
shops
,
a
large
swimming
pool
and
a
dance
hall
.

The
center
,
built
and
run
by
Panzhihua
Iron
&
Steel
,
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
social
life
in
this
town
.

Mr.
Li
walks
upstairs
to
the
center
's
second-floor
library
,
a
poorly
lit
room
where
he
spends
many
hours
leafing
through
a
thin
selection
of
state-controlled
periodicals
.

He
pulls
out
a
newspaper
:
The
Panzhihua
Iron
&
Steel
Co
.

Daily
.

``
It
's
a
good
read
,
''
Mr.
Li
says
.

``
Quite
informative
.

''
Today
's
lead
story
:
``
Manager
Zhao
Inspects
Operation
of
No.
4
Furnace
.

''

Not
surprisingly
in
this
remote
outpost
,
many
of
the
single
factory
workers
here
fall
in
love
with
each
other
.

``
We
have
a
very
small
social
circle
,
''
says
Ma
Yongjian
,
the
company
secretary
general
.

``
A
lot
of
the
young
workers
end
up
getting
married
.

''
To
facilitate
such
productive
arrangements
,
the
factory
organizes
dances

each
night
,
often
outdoors
on
a
concrete
promenade
along
the
banks
of
the
Jinshajiang
River
.

On
this
evening
,
the
dancers
seem
reluctant
,
as
a
sour
eight-piece
band
plods
through
a
series
of
Chinese
pop
songs
.

But
things
come
to
life
when
a
slender
woman
in
a
slinky
black
dress
takes
the
microphone
.

The
band
starts
in
,
and
she
begins
to
sing
``
Happy
birthday
to
you
,
''
even
though
it
is
n't
anyone

's
birthday
.

Immediately
,
hundreds
of
couples
leap
to
their
feet
and
rush
onto
the
floor
,
dancing
their
well-rehearsed
three-step
,
cheek-to-cheek
.

Happy
Birthday
,
apparently
a
big
hit
in
Panzhihua
,
lasts
for
10
glorious
minutes
.

As
the
band
plays
,
and
with
romance
in
the
air
,
Mr.
Li
recalls
how
he
came
to
Panzhihua
.

The
factory
,
one
of
Chairman
Mao
's
oddest
follies
,
dates
to
1965
.

Mao
was
sure
that
the
U.S.
,
or
perhaps
the
Soviet
Union
,
was
planning
to
attack
China
's
coast
,
so
he
decided
to
set
up
vital
industries
deep
in
the
remote
interior
.

Like
tens
of
thousands
of
others
,
Mr.
Li
was
ordered
to
go
to
Panzhihua
,
in
1971
.

``
I
lived
in
a
straw-and-mud
house
at
the
time
,
''
he
says
.

``
But
I
was
happy
to
be
here
,
to
carry
on
the
fight
against
the
imperialists
and
the
revisionists
.

''
Today

the
perceived
threat
has
passed
,
but
the
factory
is
thriving
.

What
keeps
Mr.
Li
in
Panzhihua
?

Partly
the
system
.

While
workers
ca
n't
easily
be
fired
,
they
also
ca
n't
easily
quit
to
find
jobs
elsewhere
.

The
Li
family
could
apply
for
permission
to
do
so
,
but
has
n't
tried
.

``
I
expect
I
'll
be
in
Panzhihua
for
the
rest
of
my
life
,
''
Mr.
Li
says
.

``
The
No.
1
high
school
is
pretty
good
,
and
I
have
to
think
of
my
daughter
's
future
.

''

Others
have
fled
the
remote
factory
.

Beginning
in
1979
,
it
offered
its
original
settlers

a
chance
to
leave
.

Many
had
been
forced
to
come
,
often
leaving
their
families
and
possessions
behind
.

When
the
opportunity
finally
arose
,
thousands
of
workers
departed
,
including
virtually
all
of
the
factory
's
college
graduates
and
senior
engineers
.

Ma
Zhijie
,
deputy
general
manager
of
the
factory
's
trading
department
,
wants
his
eight-year-old
son
to
have
broader
horizons
,
and
believes
education
is
the
best
ticket
out
of
Panzhihua
.

He
is
pushing
his
child
to
excel
in
school
and
teaches
him

English
at
home
.

``
I
dream
that
my
son
will
attend
college
and
find
a
good
job
somewhere
else
,
''
Mr.
Ma
says
.

Panzhihua
's
isolation
is
immediately
apparent
.

The
area
was
off
limits
to
foreign
visitors
and
reporters
until
1987
,
and
remains
effectively
sealed
off
from
contact
with
the
outside
.

What

the
factory
's
workers
know
of
the
world
comes
filtered
through
the
propaganda
machine
of
official
newspapers
and
television
,
as
well
as
political
study
sessions
.

Workers
have
a
very
sketchy
knowledge
,
for
example
,
about
the
pro-democracy
movement
,
and
its
bloody
suppression
,
in
Beijing
this
spring
.

At
one
point
,
Mr.
Li
repeats
the
theme
of
a
recent
political
study
class
and
harangues
his
American
visitor
about
U.S.
sanctions
against
China
.

``
The
Chinese
and
American
people
have
great
warmth
for
each
other
,
''
Mr.
Li
says
,
``
but
I
must
tell
you
frankly
that
I
disagree
with
President
Bush
's
policy
toward
China
.

''

His
visitor
explains
that
,
to
many
in
the
U.S.
,
the
sanctions
were
considered
too
moderate
.

Many
of
these
Americans
were
incensed
by
the
killings
in
Beijing
and
denounced
the
Chinese
government
.

``
Well
,
I
certainly
did
n't
know
any
of
that
,
''
Mr.
Li
says
,
and
abruptly
closes
the
conversation
.

As
Mr.
Li
begins
his
walk
back
home
,
he
displays
a
slight
limp
,
the
result
of
a
back
injury
.

Last
year
,
the
factory
sent
him
to
northeast
China
to
recuperate
for
six
months
,
all
expenses
paid
.

The
factory
provides
free
medical
care
to
all
workers
and
their
families
.

It
runs
a
modern
,
500-bed
hospital
and
eight
clinics
,
supported
by
$
2.5
million

a
year
in
subsidies
.

When
Mr.
Li
dies
,
Panzhihua
Iron
&
Steel
will
pay
for
his
cremation
.

And
the
next
generation
will
carry
on
.

At
the
hospital
,
Zhong
Desheng
,
the
director
,
dons
a
doctor
's
smock
and
leads
a
visitor
into
the
maternity
ward
.

A
factory
worker

who
has
just
given
birth
to
a
baby
girl
lies
on
a
bed
,
looking
bewildered
.

Her
baby
has
been
snatched
up
by
the
nurses
and
placed
alongside
nine
others
,
each
tied
up
in
a
tight
cotton
bundle
.

Mr.
Zhong
motions
to
the
wriggling
bundles
.

``
These
,
''
he
says
,
``
are
the
future
workers
of
Panzhihua
Iron
&

Four
of
Britain
's
biggest
banks
said
they
plan
to
sell
jointly
owned
Yorkshire
Bank
Group
in
an
auction

that
could
raise
between
#
850
million
(
$
1.33
billion
)
and
#
1
billion
(
$
1.57
billion
)
.

National
Westminster
Bank
PLC
,
Yorkshire
Bank
's
biggest
holder
with
a
40
%
stake
,
said
it
,
Barclays
PLC
,
Lloyds
Bank
PLC
and
Royal
Bank
of
Scotland
Group
PLC
decided
to
sell
the
250-branch
U.K.
bank
after
receiving
``
a
number
of
approaches
''
from
potential
purchasers
.

They
declined
to
identify
possible
bidders
.

At
a
news
conference
here
yesterday
,
NatWest
officials
said
they
expect
potential
interest
from
banks
throughout
continental
Europe
,
Australia
and
the
U.S
.

Yorkshire
Bank
,
which
had
pretax
profit
of
#
100.4
million
and
#
3.19
billion
in
assets
last
year
,
has
Britain
's
ninth-largest
branch
network
.

It
is
viewed
by
market
analysts
as
a
potential
target
for
banks
aiming
to
boost
their
U.K.
presence
prior
to
the
1992
development
of
a
single
market
in
financial
services
in
the
European
Community
.

Analysts
have
said
the
bank
could
fetch
a
price
of
between
8.5
and
10
times
pretax
profit
--
or
between
#
850
million
and
#
1
billion
.

Bill
Barron
,
a
NatWest
general
manager
,
said
the
banks
decided
to
push
ahead
with
the
sale
despite
yesterday
's
sharp
stock-market
fall
in
London
because
the
decision
was
strategic
and
independent
of
market
valuations
.

The
consortium-ownership
arrangement
,
which
dates
from
a
financial
reconstruction
of
Yorkshire
Bank
in
1911
,
is
outmoded
for
the
increasingly
competitive
U.K.
market
,
analysts
say
.

Barclays
owns
32
%
,
Lloyds
owns
20
%
and
Royal
Bank
of
Scotland
owns
8
%
of
Yorkshire
Bank
.

Richard
G.
Sim
,
the
man
credited
with
transforming
Applied
Power
Inc.
from
an
underachiever
into
a
feisty
player
in
the
global
market
for
hydraulic
tools
,
hopes
to
guide
a
similar
turnaround
at
the
company
's
latest
acquisition
,
Barry
Wright
Corp
.

The
45-year-old
former
General
Electric
Co.
executive
figures
it
will
be
easier
this
time
.

But
analysts
,
while
applauding
the
acquisition
,
say
Applied
's
chief
executive
faces
a
tough
challenge
in
integrating
the
two
companies
.

Barry
Wright
,
acquired
by
Applied
for
$
147
million
,
makes
computer-room
equipment
and
vibration-control
systems
.

The
Watertown
,
Mass.
,
company
's
sales
have
been
dormant
and
its
profits
have
dropped
.

Last
year
's
earnings
of
$
1.3
million
,
including
$
815,000
from
a
restructuring
gain
,
were
far
below
the
year-earlier
$
8.4
million
.

Besides
spurring
Barry
Wright
's
sales
,
which
were
$
201.7
million
in
1988
,
Mr.
Sim
must
pare
its
costs
and
product
line
.

``
The
question
is
how
long

it
's
going
to
take
Barry
Wright
to
make
a
contribution
,
''
says
F.
John
Mirek
,
an
analyst
at
Blunt
Ellis
Loewi
in
Milwaukee
.

The
answer
will
help
determine
whether
Applied
continues
to
reach
the
ambitious
goals
set
by
Mr.
Sim
.

The
Butler
,
Wis.
,
manufacturer
went
public
at
$
15.75

a
share
in
August
1987
,
and
Mr.
Sim
's
goal
then
was
a
$
29
per-share
price
by
1992
.

Strong
earnings
growth
helped
achieve
that
price
far
ahead
of
schedule
,
in
August
1988
.

The
stock
has
since
softened
,
trading
around
$
25

a
share
last
week
and
closing
yesterday
at
$
23.00
in
national
over-the-counter
trading
.

But
Mr.
Sim
has
set
a
fresh
target
of
$
50

a
share
by
the
end
of

Reaching
that
goal
,
says
Robert
T.
Foote
,
Applied
's
chief
financial
officer
,
will
require
``
efficient
reinvestment
''
of
cash
by
Applied
and
continuation
of
its
healthy
19
%
rate
of
return
on
operating
capital
.

In
Barry
Wright
,
Mr.
Sim
sees
a
situation
``
very
similar
''
to
the
one
he
faced
when
he
joined
Applied
as
president
and
chief
operating
officer
in
1985
.

Applied
,
then
a
closely
held
company
,
was
stagnating
under
the
management
of
its
controlling
family
.

While
profitable
,
it
``
was
n't
growing
and
was
n't
providing
a
satisfactory
return
on
invested
capital
,
''
he
says
.

Mr.
Sim
is
confident
that
the
drive
to
dominate
certain
niche
markets
will
work
at
Barry
Wright
as
it
has
at
Applied
.

He
also
professes
an
``
evangelical
''
fervor
to
develop
a
corporate
culture

that
rewards
managers

who
produce
and
where
decision-making
is
shared
.

Mr.
Sim
considers
the
new
unit
's
operations
``
fundamentally
sound
''
and
adds
that
Barry
Wright
has
been
fairly
successful
in
moving
into
markets

that
have
n't
interested
larger
competitors
.

``
With
a
little
patience
,
these
businesses
will
perform
very
satisfactorily
,
''
Mr.
Sim
says
.

Within
about
six
months
,
``
things
will
be
moving
in
the
right
direction
,
''
he
predicts
.

Mr.
Sim
figures
it
will
be
easier
to
turn
Barry
Wright
around
since
he
's
now
in
the
driver
's
seat
.

When
he
came
to
Applied
,
``
I
did
n't
have
the
power
to
execute
as
I
do
today
,
''
he
says
.

He
was
named
chief
executive
officer
of
Applied
in
1986
and
became
chairman
last
November
.

At
Applied
,
Mr.
Sim
set
growth
as
his
first
objective
.

He
took
the
company
public
in
an
offering

that
netted
Applied
about
$
12.6
million
,
which
helped
launch
the
company
's
acquisition
program
.

Sales
climbed
to
an
estimated
$
245
million
in
fiscal
1989
,
ended
Aug.
31
,
from
$
99.9
million
in
fiscal
1985
.

The
company
expects
that
earnings
,
which
have
marched
steadily
upward
in
recent
years
,
reached
about
$
20.8
million
,
or
$
1.58

a
share
,
in
the
fiscal
year
just
ended
,
up
from
$
15.2
million
in
fiscal
1988
and
$
3.9
million
in
1985
.

Tokyo
share
prices
dropped
sharply
in
early
Monday
morning
trading
following
Wall
Street
's
plunge
on
Friday
.

After
the
initial
slide
,
the
market
appeared
to
be
turning
around
but
by
early
afternoon
was
headed
lower
.

At
1:30
p.m
.

Tokyo
time
,
the
Nikkei
index
of
225
selected
stocks
was
off
1.4
%
,
or
482.39
points
,
to
34633.63
.

In
the
first
20
minutes
of
trading
in
the
morning
,
the
Nikkei
index
had
fallen
611.62
points
or
1.7
%
,
as
nervous
investors
sold
large
capital
issues
.

Traders
remained
guarded
.

Yoshiro
Inoue
,
an
analyst
at
Nomura
Securities
Co.
,
described
the
steep
decline
in
the
beginning
as
``
a
New
York
shock
.

''
He
predicted
that
``
there
would
be
no
steep
recovery
but
at
the
same
time

there
would
be
no
further
decline
.

''

Said
a
Japanese
equities
trader
at
Jardine
Flemings
Securities
Ltd.
,
in
Tokyo
:
``
There
is
still
a
lot
of
weakness
and
nervousness
in
the
market
.

''

Last
Friday
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
plunged
190.58
points
to
close
at
2569.26
,
its
worst
loss
in
points
since
the
October
1987
crash
.

The
announcement
that
a
group
of
takeover
bidders
for
UAL
Corp.
had
failed
to
raise
enough
money
to
acquire
the
U.S.
airline
was
one
of
the
main
factors

that
triggered
the
sell-off
,
analysts
said
.

World
stock
markets
,
bracing
over
the
weekend
for
a
sharp
fall
in
share
prices
Monday
,
were
watching
Tokyo
closely
for
signals
.

How
far
share
prices
fall
in
other
markets
will
depend
to
a
great
extent
on
how
the
Tokyo
market
reacts
,
analysts
and
investors
said
.

``
I
'm
hoping
Japan
holds
tight
,
''
said
Allen
Wheat
,
head
of
trading
at
Bankers
Trust
Co.
in
London
,
before
the
Tokyo
opening
.

``
But
if
Japan
is
wobbly
,
London
will
probably
take
a
beating
.

''

Prior
to
the
Tokyo
opening
,
few
were
expecting
panic
to
set
in
,
mainly
because
today
's
market
conditions
are
different
from
those

that
led
to
the
world-wide
downward
spiral
in
October
1987
.

The
French
market
could
be
harder
hit
than
the
London
market
,
European
analysts
said
,
because
recent
unmaterialized
takeover
speculation
in
Paris
has
left
some
blue-chip
stocks
poised
for
markdowns
.

``
Paris
has
had
an
awful
lot
of
froth
in
the
past
two
weeks
and
so
is
probably
going
to
be
hit
a
bit
worse
than
London
,
''
said
David
Band
,
chief
executive
officer
of
Barclays
Bank
PLC
's
Barclays
de
Zoete
Wedd
investment
banking
unit
.

The
Tokyo
market
's
opening
behavior
seemed
to
be
in
line
with
predictions
that
a
blood
bath
could
be
avoided
.

Analysts
in
Tokyo
had
said
over
the
weekend
that
a
drop
is
unavoidable
,
but
they
predicted
that
Japan
's
traditionally
cautious
institutional
investors
will
keep
things
from
spinning
out
of
control
.

``
The
Tokyo
market
ca
n't
help
but
go
down
,
''
said
Hiroaki
Hanao
,
deputy
general
manager
of
the
equity
department
at
Daiwa
Securities
Co
.

``
But
it
wo
n't
be
such
a
big
crash
.

''

The
Ministry
of
Finance
and
the
Bank
of
Japan
appear
to
be
eager
to
put
out
the
fire
before
it
spreads
.

Japanese
newspapers
reported
Saturday
that
the
Ministry
of
Finance
and
the
Bank
of
Japan
view

the
plunge
on
Wall
Street
as
a
result
of
U.S.
domestic
concerns
about
financing
acquisitions
,
not
as
a
sign
of
weak
economic
fundamentals
.

There
were
also
rumors
that
the
Japanese
financial
authorities
warned
large
brokerage
firms
and
institutional
investors
over
the
weekend
against
taking
any
hasty
actions
Monday
.

How
effective
such
guidance
might
be
remains
to
be
seen
.

One
analyst
said
that
with
all
eyes
on
the
Japanese
market

it
will
be
difficult
this
time
for
the
Finance
Ministry
to
try
anything

that
could
be
seen
as
artificially
propping
up
the
market
.

As
Japanese
investors
prepare
for
some
rough
waters

this
week
,
they
will
be
paying
close
attention
to
the
foreign
exchange
markets
.

``
Tokyo
is
most
worried
about
the
currency
,
''
said
Daiwa
Securities
'
Mr.
Hanao
.

If
the
yen
rebounds
against
the
dollar
,
he
said
,
there
is
less
chance
of
an
additional
increase
in
interest
rates
,
which
could
help
stabilize
Tokyo
share
prices
.

Last
Wednesday
,
the
Bank
of
Japan
raised
the
discount
rate
0.5
percentage
point
to
3.75
%
to
stem
the
dollar
's
rise
.

Of
ficials
said
they
were
concerned
that
a
weaker
yen
will
contribute
to
greater
inflation
in
Japan
.

In
New
York
trading
on
Friday

the
dollar
dropped
1.4
%
to
close
at
142.10
yen
.

Dealers
are
expecting
the
dollar
to
be
skittish
,
as
the
market
waits
for
U.S.
authorities
to
indicate
their
monetary
policy
plans
.

The
dollar
opened
in
Tokyo
at
139.95
,
down
4.05
from
last
Friday
's
Tokyo
finish
.

Despite
currency
market
concerns
,
analysts
stressed
that
Tokyo
market
conditions
today
are
n't
what

they
were
in
1987
.

Then
,
many
market
watchers
in
the
U.S.
worried
that
the
highly
speculative
Tokyo
market
would
be
the
one
to
send
world
markets
reeling
.

Now
,
many
look
to
Tokyo
as
a
potential
stabilizing
factor
because
of
its
resilience
and
quick
recovery
following
Black
Monday
.

Analysts
say
one
point
in
Tokyo
's
favor

this
time
is
the
fact
that
for
the
past
several
weeks

the
market
has
been
in
relatively
low
gear
,
driven
by
fundamental
concerns
about
earnings
and
interest
rates
rather
than
wild
speculation
.

On
Friday
,
the
Nikkei
index
rose
320.97
to
close
at
35116.02
.

Trading
volume
has
also
fallen
off
in
recent
weeks
.

``
A
lot
of
the
speculative
fat
has
been
trimmed
,
''
said
one
analyst
.

Some
analysts
predict
that
Japanese
institutions
may
look
at
this
as
a
good
time
to
hunt
for
bargains
.

Many
Japanese
funds
,
which
closed
their
books
at
the
end
of
September
,
now
have
huge
cash
positions
.

``
There
's
still
lots
of
idle
money
sitting
around
here
,
''
said
Hiroshi
Ohira
,
chief
analyst
at
New
Japan
Securities
Co.
,
citing
a
frequently
stated
reason
for
Tokyo
's
strength
.

Said
another
foreign
stock
analyst
:
``
All
the
Japanese
brokers
will
try
to
look
for
the
positive
aspects
of
this
.

''

Whatever
happens
in
Tokyo
,
the
powerful
ripple
effects
are
sure
to
be
felt
first
in
other
Asian
markets
.

A
severe
drop
in
Japanese
stock
prices
or
a
steep
fall
in
the
dollar
would
exacerbate
price
declines
in
smaller
markets
such
as
Hong
Kong
,
money
managers
say
.

In
Hong
Kong
,
brokers
and
fund
managers
expect
the
widely
watched
Hang
Seng
index
,
which
closed
Friday
at
2782.30
,
to
shed
at
least
100
points
,
or
5
%
.

Some
think
a
sharper
decline
is
possible
.

The
Hang
Seng
index
opened
at
2736
,
down
46.3
points
,
or
1.7
%
.

Investors
have
already
been
treating
the
market
with
some
caution
.

In
late
May
and
early
June
,
when
political
turmoil
overwhelmed
China
,
the
Hang
Seng
index
plummeted
37
%
to
2093
.

(
Hong
Kong
reverts
to
China
in
1997
.

)
Since
then
,
international
fund
managers
decreased
their
exposure
to
the
market
and
only
recently
have
begun
to
tiptoe
back
in
.

``
It
's
not
like
the
crash
in
October
1987
,
when
there
was
lots
of
optimism
,
''
said
Phillip
Niem
,
research
director
in
Hong
Kong
for
British-based
Hoare
Govette
Asia
Ltd
.

``
This
time
around
there

's
lots
of
caution
.

People
are
already
scared
.

Institutions
'
weighting
in
Hong
Kong
are
low
now
anyway
.

''

After
a
108-point
decline
in
the
Dow
Jones
industrials
on
Friday
,
Oct.
16
,
1987
,
the
Hang
Seng
index
plunged
420.81
points
,
or
11.3
%
,
the
following
Monday
.

Later
that
day
Black
Monday
unfolded
in
New
York
,
and
officials
closed
the
Hong
Kong
exchange
for
four
days
,
a
move

that
shook
investor
confidence
in
the
market
.

This
time
around
,
government
and
market
officials
said
,
the
territory
's
revamped
equity
market
will
remain
open
regardless
of
what
happens
in
New
York
today
.

London
's
stock
market
,
already
wheezing
under
stresses
of
its
own
,
is
also
casting
a
nervous
eye
toward
Tokyo
and
bracing
for
a
shock
.

Many
London
traders
planned
an
allnight
vigil
on
developments
in
the
Tokyo
market
.

``
A
lot
of
our
guys
will
be
sitting
up
all
night
at
home
,
and
a
couple
of
our
guys
will
be
in
the
office
overnight
,
''
said
Mr.
Wheat
of
Bankers
Trust
.

Authorities
,
including
the
Bank
of
England
and
the
Securities
Association
,
are
gearing
up
in
case

a
crisis
wallops
the
London
market
.

The
bank
was
in
touch
with
other
major
central
banks
over
the
weekend
and
was
preparing
to
make
capital
available
to
dealers
if
needed
,
as
it
did
in
the
1987
crash
,
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
bank
's
strategy
.

However
,
in
an
unusual
public
statement
,
the
bank
sought
to
play
down
any
note
of
crisis
.

Said
a
spokesman
:
``
There
's
no
reason
for
such
an
exaggerated
fall
in
London
,
where
share
values
are
n't
underpinned
in
the
same
degree
as
New
York
by
highly
leveraged
situations
.

''

The
Securities
Association
,
which
regulates
London
's
stock
markets
,
said
that
if
prices
plunge
today

all
dealers
will
be
ordered
to
report
their
capital
and
market
positions
daily
.

``
We
're
monitoring
things
very
closely
,
''
a
spokeswoman
said
.

Even
before
Friday
's
New
York
nosedive
,
the
London
market
had
been
facing
heavy
uncertainty
because
of
worries
over
the
British
economy
.

After
the
one-point
rise
Oct.
5
to
15
%
,
Britain
's
base
interest
rate
stands
at
its
highest
level
in
eight
years
.

Many
economists
have
been
predicting
that
the
country
's
economic
growth
will
be
little
more
than
1
%
in

Responding
to
the
developments
,
the
Financial
Times
100-share
index
,
which
had
been
slightly
higher
most
of
the
day
,
closed
at
2233.9
,
down
3.9
points
from
Thursday
.

The
impending
stock
market
troubles
could
pose
a
dilemma
for
already
embattled
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
Nigel
Lawson
.

A
market
plunge
in
Britain
could
bring
pressure
for
him
to
lower
interest
rates
.

But
a
rate
cut
could
weaken
the
recently
depressed
pound
,
which
late
Friday
staged
a
sharp
rally
against
the
dollar
after
news
of
the
New
York
market
sell-off
.

One
person

who
firmly
believes
London
is
headed
for
trouble

no
matter

what
happens
elsewhere
is
Peter
Thompson
.

This
widely
followed
stock
market
forecaster
achieved
fame
by
predicting
,
in
July
1987
,
the
October
crash
of
that
year
.

Mr.
Thompson
,
a
consultant
to
Barclay
de
Zoete
Wedd
Securities
Ltd.
,
jolted
the
London
market
last
Monday
by
predicting
that
another
bear
market
is
at
hand
.

``
London
will
open
lower
{
today
}
whether
or
not
Tokyo
opens
lower
,
''
Mr.
Thompson
said
in
an
interview
.

``
Market
makers
will
mark
down
prices
so
bears
ca
n't
go
short
to
them
at
too
advantageous
a
price
.

''
By
going
short
,
a
market
pessimist
sells
borrowed
shares
in
the
hope
of
buying
them
back
later
at
a
profit
.

Any
big
drop
in
London
prices
will
further
cool
the
already
jaded
British
appetite
for
leveraged
buy-outs
,
analysts
said
.

Here
are
price
trends
on
the
world
's
major
stock
markets
,
as
calculated
by
Morgan
Stanley
Capital
International
Perspective
,
Geneva
.

To
make
them
directly
comparable
,
each
index
is
based
on
the
close
of
1969
equaling
100
.

The
percentage
change
is
since
year-end
.

Britain
's
Blue
Arrow
PLC
intends
to
change
its
name
to
Manpower
PLC
and
write
off
a
chunk
of
the
nearly
$
1.2
billion
in
good
will
realized
in
the
takeover
of
U.S.-based
Manpower
Inc
.

Blue
Arrow
Chairman
Mitchell
Fromstein
said
in
an
interview
that
the
two
steps
may
be
a
prelude
to
reincorporating
the
world
's
biggest
employment-services
group
in
the
U.S
.

Mr.
Fromstein
disclosed
the
planned
steps
,
expected
within
a
few
months
,
as
Blue
Arrow
posted
a
2.5
%
drop
in
its
third-quarter
pretax
earnings
.

The
name
change
and
good
will
write-off
could
help
solidify
Blue
Arrow
's
dominance
of
the
U.S.
temporary-help
market
and
give
it

a
more
American
image
as
U.S.
investors
turn
jittery
about
foreign
stocks
after
Friday
's
market
plunge
.

U.S.
holders
now
own
more
than
60
%
of
Blue
Arrow
compared
with
9
%
last
January
.

``
In
the
U.S.
market
,
the
recognition
of
the
Manpower
name
is
infinitely
stronger
than
Blue
Arrow
,
''
Mr.
Fromstein
said
.

The
moves
also
could
erase
shareholders
'
perception
of
Blue
Arrow
as
a
company
in
turmoil
.

``
It
further
reinforces
the
concept
that
Blue
Arrow
is
a
thing
of
the
past
,
''
said
Doug
Arthur
,
an
analyst
at
Kidder
Peabody
&
Co.
in
New
York
.

The
proposed
changes
``
all
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
me
,
''
he
added
.

In
a
widely
publicized
boardroom
coup
,
Mr.
Fromstein
ousted
Antony
Berry
as
Blue
Arrow
chief
executive
in
January
,
a
month
after
Mr.
Berry
had
forced
Mr.
Fromstein
out
as
the
$
1
million-a-year
chief
of
Milwaukee-based
Manpower
.

Mr.
Fromstein
solidified
his
control
in
April
by
taking
over
from
Mr.
Berry
as
chairman
.

But
the
Blue
Arrow
tumult
is
n't
over
yet
,
as
the
British
government
is
investigating
a
disputed
#
25
million
(
$
39.4
million
)
loan

which

Mr.
Fromstein
has
said
was
made
under
Mr.
Berry
's
direction
.

Blue
Arrow
was
able
to
pull
off
the
$
1.34
billion
takeover
of
Manpower
in
1987
largely
because
different
British
and
American
accounting
standards
produce
higher
reported
earnings
for
British
companies
.

Under
British
rules
,
Blue
Arrow
was
able
to
write
off
at
once
the
$
1.15
billion
in
good
will
arising
from
the
purchase
.

As
a
U.S.-based
company
,
Blue
Arrow
would
have
to
amortize
the
good
will
over
as
many
as
40
years
,
creating
a
continuing
drag
on
reported
earnings
.

Good
will
is
the
excess
of
cost
of
an
acquired
firm
,
operating
unit
or
assets
over
the
current
or
fair
market
value
of
those
assets
.

But
with
so
many
shares
now
held
in
the
U.S.
,
Blue
Arrow
reports
its
earnings
two
ways
,
based
on
both
U.K.
and
U.S.
accounting
standards
.

``
Our
balance
sheets
look
like
they
came
from
Alice
's
wonderland
,
''
Mr.
Fromstein
said
.

The
British
version
shows
``
a
handful
of
pounds
of
net
worth
''
following
the
1987
write-off
of
good
will
,
while
the
American
version
reflects
``
$
1
billion
of
net
worth
because
almost
none
of
{
the
good
will

}
has
been
written
off
.

''

Mr.
Fromstein
said
he
hopes
to
eradicate
some
of
the
good
will
left
on
Blue
Arrow
's
U.S.
books
in
one
fell
swoop
,
but
would
n't
specify
how
much
.

People
close
to
Blue
Arrow
suggested
the
write-down
would
represent
a
sizable
chunk
,
with
executives
claiming
prior
management
overstated
the
extent
of
Manpower
's
good
will
.

That
move
,
along
with
the
return
to
the
Manpower
name
,
could
bolster
the
company
's
prospects
during
possibly
difficult
times
for
temporary
help
.

The
number
of
U.S.
temporary
workers
fell
about
1
%
in
the
12
months
ending
Aug.
31
,
after
sliding
nearly
3.5
%
in
July
,
said
Kidder
Peabody
's
Mr.
Arthur
.

Blue
Arrow
blamed
the
pretax
profit
drop
in
the
quarter
ended
July
31
partly
on
slower
earnings
growth
of
non-Manpower
units
in
Britain
.

Overall
,
pretax
profit
slid
to
#
18.49
million
in
the
quarter
from
#
18.98
million

a
year
earlier
.

While
Friday
's
plunging
stock
market
prompted
new
fears
about
the
economy
's
prospects
,
a
little-known
indicator

that
has
faithfully
foreshadowed
the
economy
's
ups
and
downs
by
exceptionally
long
lead
times
points
to
a
sustained
rise
in
overall
business
activity
.

The
barometer
,
developed
by
analysts
at
Columbia
University
's
Center
for
International
Business
Cycle
Research
here
,
reached
a
record
high
of
223.0
in
August
,
the
latest
month
available
,
and
the
Columbia
researchers
estimate
that
it
has
moved
even
higher
since
then
.

The
latest
reading
of
223.0
was
up
from
222.3
in
July
and
215.3
as
recently
as
March
.

The
August
rise
marked
the
fifth
straight
monthly
gain
for
the
indicator
,
which
uses
the
1967
average
as
a
base
of
100
.

In
contrast
,
the
Commerce
Department
's
widely
followed
index
of
leading
indicators
,
while
up
in
August
,
has
fallen
repeatedly
since
reaching
a
high
early
this
year
.

Its
ragged
behavior
through
much
of
1989
has
prompted
some
forecasters
to
anticipate
the
start
of
a
new
recession
perhaps
before
year
's
end
.

But
the
far
stronger
showing
of
the
Columbia
index
``
makes
a
recession

any
time
soon
highly
unlikely
,
''
says
Geoffrey
H.
Moore
,
the
director
of
the
Columbia
facility
.

A
leading
authority
on
the
business
cycle
,
Mr.
Moore
also
is
a
member
of
the
Business
Cycle
Dating
Group
,
the
panel
of
private
economists

that
decides
for
the
government
when
expansions
and
recessions
begin
and
end
.

The
group
normally
convenes
only
when
a
change
in
the
economy
's
general
course
seems
likely
.

``
No
meeting
is
scheduled
because
the
expansion
shows
no
sign
of
going
off
the
tracks
,
''
Mr.
Moore
reports
.

Based
largely
on
the
recent
strength
in
their
index
,
called
the
long
leading
indicator
,
the
Columbia
analysts
foresee
uninterrupted
economic
growth
through
the
rest
of
this
year
and
next
year
as
well
.

They
expect
a
2.6
%
rise
in
1990
in
the
gross
national
product
,
after
adjustment
for
inflation
.

Underlying
this
optimism
is
the
index
's
longstanding
ability
to
signal
recessions
or
recoveries
,
as
the
case
may
be
,
by
substantially
greater
periods
than
the
Commerce
Department
's
index
of
leading
indicators
.

Over
the
full
post-World
War
II
era
,
the
Columbia
index
,
on
the
average
,
has
entered
sustained
declines
14
months
before
the
onset
of
recessions
and
turned
up
eight
months
before
recoveries
.

The
comparable
lead
times
for
the
Commerce
index
,
whose
components
include
the
stock
market
,
are
far
shorter
--
10
months
before
recessions
and
only
three
months
before
recoveries
.

The
Columbia
economists
also
have
reconstructed
how
the
long
leading
index
would
have
behaved
,
had
it
existed
,
in
1929
,
before
the
stock
market
crash
in
October

that
ushered
in
the
Great
Depression
.

The
indicator
reached
a
peak
in
January
1929
and
then
fell
steadily
up
to
and
through
the
crash
.

``
It
was
an
entirely
different
pattern
from
what

we
're
seeing
now
,
''
Mr.
Moore
says
.

A
major
source
of
the
recent
strength
in
the
long
leading
indicator
has
been
the
performance
of
the
Dow
Jones
corporate
bond-price
index
,
which
is
not
a
part
of
the
Commerce
index
.

In
August
,
the
bond
measure
was
at
its
highest
monthly
average
since
early
1987
.

It
also
rose
last
Friday
,
while
the
stock
market
sagged
.

Other
components
of
the
long
leading
indicator
include
a

Notably
absent
from
the
Columbia
index
is
the
stock
market
,
which

Mr.
Moore
says
``
is
simply
no
longer
such
a
good
indicator
of
the
economy
's
long-range
prospects
,
though
it
still
is
useful
for
anticipating
some
short-run
twists
and
turns
.

''

As
recently
as
1975
,
the
stock
market
--
as
reflected
in
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
index
of
500
common
stocks
--
was
rated
by
the
National
Bureau
of
Economic
Research
as
the
best
of
the
12
leading
indicators

that
then
made
up
the
Commerce
index
.

It
was
assigned
a
mark
of
80
out
of
a
possible
100
,
compared
with
scores
ranging
as
low
as
69
for
the
other
components
.

The
stock
market
has
lost
some
precursory
power
,
analysts
at
the
Columbia
center
claim
,
because
of
the
growing
impact
of
international
developments
.

``
Stocks
have
become
more
sensitive
to
factors
not
directly
tied
to
the
domestic
economy
,
''
Mr.
Moore
says
,
citing
the
exchange
rate
for
the
dollar
on
currency
markets
,
the
foreign-trade
balance
and
inflows
of
foreign
capital
.

He
also
feels
that
the
rise
of
such
computer-based
practices
as
program
trading
has
diminished
the
stock
market
's
relevancy
to
the
economic
outlook
.

The

J.P.

swung
to

while

reported

income
more
than
doubled
,
and
Security
Pacific
Corp.
net
rose
10
%
.

J.P.
Morgan
&
Co
.

J.P.
Morgan
,
as
expected
,
posted
a
$
1.82
billion
net
loss
for
the
quarter
,
reflecting
the
New
York
bank
's
decision
last
month
to
add
$
2
billion
to
reserves
for
losses
on
loans
to
less-developed
countries
.

The
reserve
addition
placed
the
parent
of
Morgan
Guaranty
Trust
Co.
among
a
few
major
U.S.
banks

that
have
covered
nearly
all
their
medium
and
long-term
portfolios
to
less-developed
countries
with
reserves
.

The
latest
quarter
's
loss
equals
$
9.92

a
share
.

In
the
year-earlier
quarter
,
Morgan
earned
$
233.6
million
,
or
$
1.25

a
share
.

George
M.
Salem
,
analyst
at
Prudential-Bache
Securities
Inc.
,
called
the
results
``
mildly
disappointing
.

''
Excluding
the
$
2
billion
provision
and
allowing
for
the
taxes
Morgan
paid
,
earnings
were
about
65
cents

a
share
,
Mr.
Salem
said
.

In
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
yesterday
,
Morgan
climbed
$
1.50

a
share
to
$
44.125
.

Net
interest
income
sank
27
%
in
the
quarter
to
$
254
million
from
$
347
million
.

The
interest
rate
on
short-term
funds
,
which
banks
borrow
to
finance
longer-term
loans
to
customers
,
was
``
sharply
higher
,
''
Morgan
said
.

Morgan
received
$
2
million
of
interest
payments
on
its
medium
and
long-term
Brazilian
loans
;
had
they
been
accruing
interest
,
net
interest
income
would
have
been
$
35
million
higher
in
the
quarter
,
Morgan
said
.

Such
loans
to
Argentina
also
remain
classified
as
non-accruing
,
costing
the
bank
$
10
million
of
interest
income
in
the
third
period
.

Income
from
sources
other
than
interest
climbed
12
%
to
$
414
million
,
reflecting
higher
corporate-finance
and
other
fees
and
gains
on
sales
of
investment
securities
.

``
These
increases
were
partly
offset
by
lower
trading-related
''
income
,
the
bank
said
.

Non-interest
expenses
grew
16
%
to
$
496
million
.

NCNB
Corp
.

NCNB
Corp.
's
net
income
more
than
doubled
in
the
period
,
largely
because
of
continued
strong
performance
by
the
bank
's
Texas
operations
.

The
Charlotte
,
N.C.
,
company
said
earnings
rose
to
$
143.6
million
,
or
$
1.45

a
share
,
from
$
58.9
million
,
or
69
cents

a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

The
latest
quarter
included
a
gain
of
$
56.1
million
,
or
59
cents

a
share
,
related
to
the
purchase
of
the
remaining
51
%
of
NCNB
Texas
National
Bank
from
the
Federal
Deposit
Insurance
Corp
.

The
strong
performance
,
however
,
contrasted
with
an
unexpectedly
large
increase
in
the
size
of
NCNB
's
problem
loans
,
particularly
in
the
Southeast
.

In
the
third
quarter
,
nonperforming
assets
jumped
to
$
474.1
million
,
or
1.43
%
of
net
loans
and
leases
,
from
$
232.8
million
,
or
1.13
%
in
the
second
quarter
.

Nonperformers
totaled
$
230.8
million
,
or
1.27
%
in
the
year-ago
third
quarter
.

Included
in
the
increase
in
the
most
recent
quarter
is
a
$
33
million
loan
,
which

NCNB
said
it
``
expects
to
be
fully
repaid
,
with
no
loss
,
early
in
the
fourth
quarter
.

''

The
deterioration
in
credit
quality
offset
strong
loan
growth
of
17
%
in
NCNB
's
Southeast
operations
,
as
well
as
a
28
%
growth
in
deposits
resulting
from
an
aggressive
marketing
campaign
.

The
higher
rates
paid
on
deposits
also
helped
squeeze
NCNB
's
net
interest
margin
in
the
Southeast
to
3.38
%
from
3.80
%

a
year
earlier
.

In
Big
Board
composite
trading
yesterday
,
NCNB
jumped
$
3.50

a
share
,
to
$
51
.

Results
were
released
after
the
market
closed
.

NCNB
Texas
National
,
formed
from
the
remnants
of
of
the
failed
First
RepublicBank
Corp.
of
Dallas
,
contributed
$
76.9
million
to
NCNB
's
bottom
line
in
the
third
quarter
.

NCNB
said
its
third-quarter
results
reflect
100
%
of
earnings
of
the
Texas
operation
since
Aug.
1
.

NCNB
raised
some
$
1.9
billion
in
new
capital
during
the
quarter
to
complete
the
NCNB
Texas
purchase
,
and
to
acquire
several
small
failed
thrifts
to
fill
out
its
regional
franchise
.

Last
week
,
the

company
said
it

Association

Tampa
,
Fla.
,
and
University
Federal
Savings
Association
of
San
Antonio
,
Texas
,
for
$
169.4
million
.

In
the
first
nine
months
,
NCNB
's
net
income
climbed
65
%
to
$
310.9
million
,
or
$
3.30

a

from
$

or

a
year
earlier
.

Security
Pacific
Corp
.

Security
Pacific
's
earnings
growth
slowed
in
the
third
quarter
,
but
the
Los
Angeles
bank
holding
company
was
still
able
to
post
a
10
%
increase
in
net
income
because
of
robust
growth
in
residential
real-estate
and
consumer
loans
.

Net
rose
to
$
185.1
million
,
or
$
1.55

a
share
,
from
$
167.9
million
,
or
$
1.47

a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

The
company
said
the
gain
resulted
mainly
from
a
$
54
million
increase
in
net
interest
income
,
reflecting
a
33
%
increase
in
real
estate
loans
(
mainly
residential
)
,
and
a
19
%
rise
in
consumer
loans
.

These
high-yielding
loans
in
effect
replaced
some
low-yielding
assets
such
as
inter-bank
loans
,
which
were
allowed
to
decrease
.

As
a
result
,
Security
Pacific
's
net
interest
margin
fell
only
13
basis
points
,
a
more
mild
decrease
than
some
major
banks
outside
California
,
which
have
been
reporting
more
sluggish
earnings
.

Security
Pacific
shares
closed
at
$
44.625
,
down
37.5
cents
,
in
Big
Board
composite
trading
.

The
earnings
represent
a
0.89
%
return
on
assets
for
Security
Pacific
,
and
an
18.9
%
return
on
equity
.

The
loan
growth
offset
continuing
real-estate
loan
losses
in
the
depressed
Arizona
market
.

Security
Pacific
reported
a
33
%
increase
in
net
credit
losses
for
the
quarter
,
to
$
109
million
from
$
81.9
million
in
the
year-ago
period
.

Nonperforming
loans
grew
slightly
to
$
1.75
billion
at
Sept.
30
,
from
$
1.7
billion

a
year
ago
.

Security
Pacific
's
loan-loss
provision
was
down
22
%
,
or
$
30.4
million
,
because
it
added
to
its
foreign-debt
reserve
the
year
before
.

Non-interest
income
fell
6
%
in
the
quarter
,
mainly
because
of
an
unusual
gain

a
year
earlier
from
the
sale
of
Hong
Kong
banking
operations
.

Non-interest
expense
grew
only
4
%
in
the
period
.

For
the
nine
months
,
net
rose
17
%
to
$
548.9

4.67

tunes
.

Baseball
,
that
game
of
the
long
haul
,
is
the
quintessential
sport
of
the
mean
,
and
the
mean
ol'
law
caught
up
with
the
San
Francisco
Giants
in
the
World
Series
last
weekend
.

The
team

that
dumped
runs
by
the
bushel
on
the
Chicago
Cubs
in
the
National
League
playoffs
was
held
to
just
one
in
two
games
by
the
home-team
Oakland

A

's
,
the
gang

that
had
been
done
unto
similarly
by
the
Los
Angeles
Dodgers
and
Orel
Hershiser
in
last
year
's
tournament
.

Morever
,
much
of
the
damage
was
accomplished
by
A

's

who
had
some
catching
up
to
do
.

In
game
two
,
on
a
cool
Sunday
evening
in
this
land
of
perpetual
autumn
,
a
lot
of
the
catching
up
was
done
by
the

A

's
catcher
,
Terry
Steinbach
.

He
hit
a
2-0
pitch
from
Rick
Reuschel
into
the
left-field
stands
in
inning
four
to
stretch
his
team
's
lead
from
2-1
to
a
decisive
5-1
,
where
it
stayed
.

So
what
if
Steinbach
had
struck
just
seven
home
runs
in
130
regular-season
games
,
and
batted
in
the
seventh
position
of
the

A

's
lineup
.

``
If
you
get
your
pitch
,
and
take
a
good
swing
,
anything
can
happen
,
''
he
later
remarked
.

On
Saturday
night
,
quite
a
few
of
the
boys
in
green
and
gold
salted
away
successes
to
salve
the
pain
of
past
and
,
no
doubt
,
future
droughts
.

Mark
McGwire
,
the
big
,
red-haired
Oakland
first
baseman
,
had
three
hits
in
four
at
bats
,
two
more
than
he
'd
had
in
the
five-game
Dodger
series
in
which

he
'd
gone
1-for-17
.

The
A-men
batting
Nos.
6
through
9
,
a.k.a.
the
``
bottom
of
the
order
,
''
got
seven
of
their
team
's
11
hits
and
scored
four
of
its
runs
in
a
5-0
decision
.

Right-hander
Dave
Stewart
held
the
Giants
to
five
hits
to
account
for
the
zero
on
the
other
side
of
the
Saturday
ledger
.

That
he
was
the

A

's
winningest
pitcher
during
its
American
League
campaign
with
a
21-9
mark
,
plus
two
wins
over
Toronto
in
the
playoffs
,
indicates
he
may
have
some
evening
up
coming
,
but
with
the
way
his
split-fingered
fastball
is
behaving
,
that
might
not
be
this
week
.

The
same
goes
for
Mike
Moore
,
another
veteran

who
overcame
early
struggles
to
permit
the
Giants
but
a
run
and
four
hits
in
seven
innings
in
Sunday
's
contest
.

``
Every
guy

they
put
out
there
had
a
better
split-finger
than
the
guy
before
,
''
marveled
Giant
manager
Roger
Craig
.

He
's
an
ex-hurler

who
's
one
of
the
leading
gurus
of
the
fashionable
delivery
,
which
looks
like
a
fastball
until
it
dives
beneath
the
lunging
bat
.

The
upshot
of
the
downshoot
is
that
the

A

's
go
into
San
Francisco
's
Candlestick
Park
tonight
up
two
games
to
none
in
the
best-of-seven
fest
.

The
stat
to
reckon
with
here
says
that
about
three
of
four
clubs
(
29
of
39
)
that
took
2-0
Series
leads
went
on
to
win
it

all
.

That
's
not
an
average
to
soothe
Giant
rooters
.

One
might
think
that
the
home
fans
in
this
Series
of
the
Subway
Called
BART
(
that
's
a
better
name
for
a
public
conveyance
than
``
Desire
,
''
do
n't
you
think
?

)
would
have
been
ecstatic
over
the
proceedings
,
but
they
observe
them
in
relative
calm
.

Partisans
of
the
two
combatants
sat
side
by
side
in
the
49,000-plus
seats
of
Oakland
Coliseum
,
and
while
they
cheered
their
favorites
and
booed
the
opposition
,
hostilities
advanced
no
further
,
at
least
as
far
as
I
could
see
.

A
few
folks
even
showed
up
wearing
caps
bearing
the
colors
and
emblems
of
both

teams
.

``
I
'm
for
the
Giants
today
,
but
only
because
they
lost
yesterday
.

I
love
'em
both
.

The
only
thing

I
'm
rooting
for
is
for
the
Series
to
go
seven
games
,
''
said
David
Williams
,
a
Sacramento
septuagenarian
,
at
the
Coliseum
before
Sunday
's
go
.

The
above
represents
a
triumph
of
either
apathy
or
civility
.

I
choose
to
believe
it
's
the
latter
,
although
it
probably
springs
from
the
fact
that
just
about
everyone
out
here
,
including
the

A

's
and
Giants
,
is
originally
from
somewhere
else
.

Suffice
it
to
say
that
if
this
were
a
New
York
Yankees-Mets
series
,
or
one
between
the
Chicago
Cubs
and
White
Sox

(
hey
,
it
's
possible
)
,
you
'd
need
uniformed
police
in
every
other
seat
to
separate
opposing
fans
,
and
only
the
suicidal
would
bifurcate
their
bonnets
.

Anyway
,
the

A

's
gave
you

a
lot
of
heroes
to
root
for
.

In
the
opening
game
,
besides
Steinbach
and
Stewart
,
there
was
Walt
Weiss
,
a
twiggy-looking
,
second-year
shortstop

who
had
lost
a
couple
months
of
the
season
to
knee
surgery
.

He
was
flawless
afield
(
ditto
in
game
two
)
,
moved
a
runner
along
in
the

A

's
three-run
second
inning
,
and
homered
for
his
team
's
final
tally
.

Such
is
his
reputation
among
the
East
Bay
Bashers
that
when
he
hit
his
first
career
home
run
last
season
,
the
fan

who
caught
it
agreed
to
turn
the
ball
over
to
him
in
return
for
an
autograph
.

Not
his
autograph
;
power-hitter
McGwire
's
.

An

A

's
co-hero
of
the
second
game
was
Rickey
Henderson
,
who
exemplifies
the
hot
side
of
the
hot-cold
equation
.

He
smoked
Toronto
in
the
playoffs
with
six
hits
,
seven
walks
and
eight
stolen
bases
in
22
at
bats
,
and
continued
that
by
going
3-for-3
at
the
plate
Sunday
,
along
with
walking
,
stealing
a
base
and
scoring
a
run
.

``
When
you
're
in
the
groove
,
you
see
every
ball
tremendously
,
''
he
lectured
.

The
cold
guys
in
the
set
were
Will
Clark
,
Kevin
Mitchell
and
Matt
Williams
,
the
Giants
'
3-4-5
hitters
.

They
combined
for
25
hits
,
six
home
runs
and
24
runs
batted
in
in
the
five
games
against
the
Cubs
.

They
went
a
collective
5-for-24
here
,
with
zero
homers
and
ribbies
.

It

's
that
last
set
of
numbers
,
as
much
as
anything
else
,
that
gives
the
Giants
hope
in
the
Series
games
to
come
.

``
I
believe
in
the
law
of
averages
,
''
declared
San
Francisco
batting
coach
Dusty
Baker
after
game
two
.

``
I
'd
rather
see
a
so-so
hitter

who
's
hot
come
up
for
the
other
side
than
a
good
hitter

who
's
cold
.

''

But
the
old
Dodger
slugger
wisely
offered
no
prediction
about
when
good
times
would
return
to
his
side
.

``
When
it
goes
,
you
never
know
when
you
'll
get
it
back
,
''
he
said
.

``
That
's
baseball
.

announced
the
creation

The

apart
from
those

said
the
combined
group
,
which
will
include
businesses
such
as

confectionery
,
will
have
annual

A

EUROPE
poses

The

''
--

concerns
--
of
the
European
Community
's
plan
to
open
its
internal
borders
in
1992
could
set
the
effort
``
off
the
rails
''
if
not
done
reasonably
,
says
General
Electric
senior
vice
president
Frank
Doyle
.

U.S.
companies
wanting
to
expand
in
Europe
face
``
tough
pressure
''
from
unions
in
nations
such
as
West
Germany
,
which
play
a
big
consulting
role
in
management
decisions
,
he
says
.

FMC
Corp.
and
Baxter
International
say
unions
also
wo
n't
like
plant
relocations
and
needed
restructuring
,
which
means
layoffs
.

Many
employers
have
already
begun
moving
to
southern
countries
such
as
Spain
and
Italy
,
where
wages
are
low

CLUBBING

A
FAN
was
n't

the
Baltimore
Orioles
'
fault
.

So
said
a
federal
judge
,
in
a
case
involving
two
players
for
the
minor
league
Bluefield
,
Va.
,
Orioles
,
a
Baltimore
farm
team
.

The
players
were
heckled
by
a
patron
during
a
July
4
,
1988
,
game
with
the
Martinsville
Phillies
.

Like
its
parent

that
year
,
``
Bluefield
was
not
having
a
good
year
,
''
the
judge
said
.

After
the
game
(
``
Bluefield
lost
,
9-8
,
stranding
three
runners
in
...
the
ninth
,
''
he
noted
)
,
trouble
began
.

More
taunting
in
the
parking
lot
,
the
players
said
,
led
to
a
fight
.

The
fan
said
he
was
punched
and
kicked
by
one
player
and
that
the
other
broke
his
jaw
with
a
baseball
bat
.

The
judge
dismissed
the
fan
's
suit
against
the
team
,
however
,
ruling
the
Orioles
innocent
of
negligent
hiring
,
and
not
responsible
for
a
fight

that
was
outside
the
players
'
employment
.

PROPOSALS
ARISE
for
coping
with
the
shortage
of
nurses
.

An
Association
of
Academic
Health
Centers
report
urges
freeing
nurses
from
duties

that
do
n't
require
special
skills
.

It
also
recommends
better
retirement
and
day-care
benefits
,
and
basing
pay
on
education
,
experience
and
nurses
'
demanding
work
schedules
.

But
it
opposes
an
American
Medical
Association
proposal
for
creating
a
``
registered
care
technologist
,
''
as
``
potentially
divisive
''
;
it
says
the
job
would
entail
an
unwanted
new
doctor
's
``
bedside
''
extension
.

Over
a
third
of
618
hospitals
surveyed
by
consultant
Hewitt
Associates
use
a
``
clinical
ladder
,
''
basing
advancement
on
performance
and
education
.

Many
also
use
recruiting
bonuses
,
tuition
reimbursement
,
loan
repayment
or
child-care
help
.

Some
give
lump-sum
incentives
.

MRA
Staffing
Systems

travel

promising
annual
income
up
to

50,000

TREATING
EMPLOYEES
with
respect
is
crucial
for
managers
,
says
consultant
Hay
Group
after
surveys
of
a
million
workers
.

It
's
in
their
top
five
``
work
values
.

''
Fully
80
%
of
employees

who
say
their
bosses
treat
them
with
respect
,
but
only
a
third
of
those

who
do
n't
feel
respected
say
they
're
satisfied
with
where
they
work
.

a
Bureau

,
the

of

Services
says
;
its
survey
of

such
employees
shows
82
%
with
more
than
a
high-school
education
,
and
31
%
with

degrees
.

About
12
%

HOME-SALE
LOSSES
rise
,
but
they
're
often
covered
by
employers
.

But
they
search
for
ways
to
limit
the
damage
.

A
third
of
439
companies
surveyed
by
the
Employee
Relocation
Council
report
a
rise
in
1988
sales
losses
over
1987
.

About
72
%
reimburse
for
all
or
some
losses
.

Since
1984
,
more
companies
give
sales-loss
aid
,
as
many
real-estate
values
depreciated
,
the
council
says
.

RJR
Nabisco
pays
up
to
$
30,000
of
losses
,
including
improvements
.

Goodrich
wo
n't
ensure
loss
coverage
,
but
will
prevent
a
``
catastrophic
loss
''
;
it
has
given
some
employees

the
full
purchase
price
when
values
fell
from
concern
over
dangers
posed
by

will
buy
the
home
or
let
the
worker
sell
to
an
outside
firm
,
but
usually
wo
n't
cover
a
loss
.

Since
1984
,
firms
offering
prepurchase
house
appraisals
,
to
deter
overpaying
,
rose
to
40
%
of
those

million
of
its
real

holdings
to
Trizec

Inc.
,
a

of
Canada
's

.

Jack
Davis
,
Dataproducts

chief
executive
officer
,
said
the
company
``
is
at
a
loss
to
understand
DPC
's

''
He
called
today
's
announcement
``
opportunistic

and
said
the

intends
to
proceed
with
its
restructuring
.

Allegheny
Ludlum
Corp.
expects
to
report
third-quarter
net
of
about
$
34
million
,
or
$
1.50

a
share
,
down
from
$
38.4
million
,
or
$
1.70

a
share
,
a
year
earlier
,
Richard
P.
Simmons
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
,
told
institutional
investors
in
New
York
.

Sales
for
the
Pittsburgh-based
producer
of
specialty
steels
and
other
materials
fell
to
about
$
265
million
in
the
third
quarter
from
$
320.5
million

a
year
earlier
,
he
said
.

He
said
the
third-quarter
estimate
indicates
profit
for
the
nine
months
of
$
4.65

a
share
,
``
almost
equal
to
the
full-year
1988
earnings
''
of
$
108.6
million
,
or
$
4.81

a
share
.

In
the
first
nine
months
of
1988
,
net
was
$
85
million
,
or
$
3.76

a
share
.

Mr.
Simmons
said
the
third-quarter
results
reflect
continued
improvements
in
productivity
and
operating
margins
.

He
said
capital
spending
next
year
will
rise
to
about
$
45
million
from
about
$
35
million
this
year
.

Enron
Corp.
,
Houston
,
said
the
sale
of
preference
units
of
its
newly
formed
Enron
NGL
Partners
L.P.
master
limited
partnership
subsidiary
will
result
in
an
undetermined
gain
in
the
fourth
quarter
.

In
the
year-ago
quarter
,
the
natural
gas
concern
had
net
income
of
$
25.2
million
,
or
34
cents

a
share
,
on
revenue
of
about
$
1.46
billion
.

Those
results
included
a
$
2.7
million
charge
related
to
the
retirement
of
debt
.

In
a
related
move
,
Enron
said
it
increased
the
number
of
the
partnership
's
units

it
will
offer
to
6,930,000
from
5,500,000
.

The
old
and
revised
numbers

both
include
over-allotment
provisions
.

Enron
said
each
unit
will
be
priced
in
the
$
19-to-$21
range
and
will
represent
about
80
%
of
the
partnership
equity
.

Net
proceeds
from
the
offering
are
expected
to
be
close
to
$
200
million
.

Goldman

The
Communications
Workers
of
America
ratified
a
new
regional
contract
and
all
but
one
of
the
local

.

CWA
's
New
Jersey
Commercial
local
,
which
represents
about
2,500
service
representatives
and
marketing
employees
,
rejected
the
tentative
agreement
.

Both

the
union
and
the
regional
telephone
company
said
they
were
working
together
to
resolve
differences
.

The
new
three-year
contracts
,
which
replace
ones

that
expired
Aug.
5
,
cover
41,000
Bell
Atlantic
employees
.

The
ratification
follows
a
23-day
strike
against
the
Philadelphia-based

.

Meanwhile
,
CWA

International
Brotherhood
of
Electrical

against
Nynex
Corp.
,
the
New

company
.

The
unions
and
the
company
last
week
agreed
to
mediation
.

The
CWA
represents
40,000
Nynex
workers
and
the
IBEW
represents

Omnicare
Inc.
,
which
intends
to
expand
its
position
in
the
medical
and
dental
markets
,
said
it
acquired
a
cotton
and
gauze
products
division
from
closely
held
Sterile
Products
Corp.
for
$
8.2
million
.

Omnicare
said
it
expects
the
division
to
add
``
substantial
sales
volume
and
to
make
a
positive
contribution
to
our
earnings
in
1990
and
beyond
.

''

In
1988

the
Cincinnati

earned
$
3.1
million
,
or
32
cents

a

$
148.5
million
.

Omnicare
said
the
division
operates
under
the
trade
name
ACCO
and
supplies
the
medical
and
dental
markets
.

The
business
,
based
in

Ambassador

,
``
If

is

Burmah
Oil
PLC
,
a
British
independent
oil
and
specialty
chemicals
marketing
concern
,
said
SHV
Holdings
N.V.
of
the
Netherlands
has
built
up
a
6.7
%
stake
in
the
company
.

James
Alexander
,
a
Burmah
spokesman
,
said
SHV
had
previously
owned
``
a
little
under
5
%
''
of
Burmah
for
about
two
years
.

The
Dutch
company
had
n't
notified
Burmah
of
its
reason
for
increasing
the
stake
,
he
said
.

SHV
,
which

last
year
merged
its
North
Sea
oil
and
gas
operations
with
those
of
Calor
Group
PLC
,
has
been
pegged
by
speculators
as
a
possible
suitor
for
Burmah
Oil
in
recent
weeks
.

SHV
also
owns
40
%
of
Calor
.

Burmah
,
which
owns
the
Castrol
brand
of
lubricant
oils
,
reported
a
17

Health
and
Human
Services
Secretary
Louis
Sullivan
has
chosen
Antonia
Novello
to
be
the
next
surgeon
general
,
Bush
administration
officials
said
.

If
she
is
nominated
by
President
Bush
and
confirmed
by
the
Senate
,
Dr.
Novello
would
succeed
C.
Everett
Koop
,
who
rattled
liberals
and
conservatives
alike
with
his
outspoken
views
on
a
range
of
health
issues
.

Dr.
Novello
,
an
expert
on
pediatric
kidney
diseases
,
is
deputy
director
of
the
National
Institute
of
Child
Health
and
Human
Development
.

She
has
also
served
on
several
task
forces
on
acquired
immune
deficiency
syndrome
.

Dr.
Novello
's
office
said
she
would
n't
talk
with
reporters
,
and
it
refused
to
release
any
information
about
her
.

The
newsletter
Medicine
&
Health
,
which
first
disclosed
her
selection
by
Dr.
Sullivan
,
said
she
is
44
years
old
and
she
studied
at
the
University
of
Puerto
Rico
School
of
Medicine
.

Influential
members
of
the
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
introduced
legislation

that
would
restrict
how
the
new
savings-and-loan
bailout
agency
can
raise
capital
,
creating
another
potential
obstacle
to
the
government
's
sale
of
sick
thrifts
.

The
bill
,
whose
backers
include
Chairman
Dan
Rostenkowski
(
D.
,
Ill.
)
,
would
prevent
the
Resolution
Trust
Corp.
from
raising
temporary
working
capital
by
having
an
RTC-owned
bank
or
thrift
issue
debt

that
would
n't
be
counted
on
the
federal
budget
.

The
bill
intends
to
restrict
the
RTC
to
Treasury
borrowings
only
,
unless
the
agency
receives
specific
congressional
authorization
.

``
Such
agency
`
self-help
'
borrowing
is
unauthorized
and
expensive
,
far
more
expensive
than
direct
Treasury
borrowing
,
''
said
Rep.
Fortney
Stark
(
D.
,
Calif.
)
,
the
bill
's
chief
sponsor
.

The
complex
financing
plan
in
the
S&L
bailout
law
includes
raising
$
30
billion
from
debt
issued
by
the
newly
created
RTC
.

This
financing
system
was
created
in
the
new
law
in
order
to
keep
the
bailout
spending
from
swelling
the
budget
deficit
.

Another
$
20
billion
would
be
raised
through
Treasury
bonds
,
which
pay
lower
interest
rates
.

But
the
RTC
also
requires
``
working
''
capital
to
maintain
the
bad
assets
of
thrifts

that
are
sold
,
until
the
assets
can
be
sold
separately
.

That
debt
would
be
paid
off
as
the
assets
are
sold
,
leaving
the
total
spending
for
the
bailout
at
$
50
billion
,
or
$
166
billion
including
interest
over
10
years
.

``
It
's
a
problem

that
clearly
has
to
be
resolved
,
''
said
David
Cooke
,
executive
director
of
the
RTC
.

The
agency
has
already
spent
roughly
$
19
billion
selling
34
insolvent
S&Ls
,
and
it
is
likely
to
sell
or
merge
600
by
the
time

the
bailout
concludes
.

Absent
other
working
capital
,
he
said
,
the
RTC
would
be
forced
to
delay
other
thrift
resolutions
until
cash
could
be
raised
by
selling
the
bad
assets
.

``
We
would
have
to
wait
until
we
have
collected
on
those
assets
before
we
can
move
forward
,
''
he
said
.

The
complicated
language
in
the
huge
new
law
has
muddied
the
fight
.

The
law
does
allow
the
RTC
to
borrow
from
the
Treasury
up
to
$
5
billion
at
any
time
.

Moreover
,
it
says
the
RTC
's
total
obligations
may
not
exceed
$
50
billion
,
but
that
figure
is
derived
after
including
notes
and
other
debt
,
and
subtracting
from
it

the
market
value
of
the
assets

the
RTC
holds
.

But
Congress
did
n't
anticipate
or
intend
more
public
debt
,
say
opponents
of
the
RTC
's
working-capital
plan
,
and
Rep.
Charles
Schumer
(
D.
,
N.Y
.

)
said
the
RTC
Oversight
Board
has
been
remiss
in
not
keeping
Congress
informed
.

``
That
secrecy
leads
to
a
proposal
like
the
one
from
Ways
and
Means
,
which
seems
to
me

sort
of
draconian
,
''
he
said
.

``
The
RTC
is
going
to
have
to
pay
a
price
of
prior
consultation
on
the
Hill
if
they
want
that
kind
of
flexibility
.

''

The
Ways
and
Means
Committee
will
hold
a
hearing
on
the
bill
next
Tuesday
.

EAST
GERMANS
RALLIED
as
officials
reportedly
sought
Honecker
's
ouster
.

In
what
was
considered
the
largest
protest
in
the
Communist
state
's
40-year
history
,
at
least
120,000
demonstrators
marched
through
the
southern
city
of
Leipzig
to
press
demands
for
democratic
freedoms
,
opposition
activists
said
.

Police
did
n't
intervene
.

Meanwhile
,
as
the
first
of
more
than
1,300
East
Germans
trying
to
flee
to
the
West
through
Poland
renounced
their
citizenship
,
a
West
German
newspaper
reported
that
regional
Communist
officials
demanded
the
dismissal
of
hard-line
leader
Honecker
.

Secretary
of
State
Baker
,
in
a

Gorbachev
blamed
the

Union
's
press
for
contributing
to
the
nation
's
mounting
problems
.

At
a
meeting
Friday
,
the
Kremlin
leader
complained
about
recent
articles

that
raised
the
possiblity
of
civil
unrest
,
and
accused
the
media
of
fueling
panic
buying
of
goods
by
publishing
stories
about
impending
shortages
.

House-Senate
conferees
approved
a
permanent
smoking
ban
on
domestic
airline
routes
within
the
continental
U.S.
and
on
flights
of
less
than
six
hours
to
Alaska
and
Hawaii
.

The
curbs
would
cover
all
but
a
small
percentage
of
flights
,
and
represent
an
expansion
of
the
current
ban
on
flights
of
less

250,000
for
his
racketeering
conviction
in
the
Wedtech

Washington
dismissed
a
lawsuit
by
anti-nuclear
groups
to
delay
the
flight
because
the
plutonium-powered
Galileo
space
probe
was
aboard
.

The
space
agency
said
it
did

to
block
the
liftoff
.

The
Bush
administration
is
preparing
to
extend
a
ban
on
federal
financing
of
research
using
fetal
tissue
,
government
sources
said
.

A
temporary
prohibition
was
imposed
in
March
1988
.

While
anti-abortion
groups
are
opposed
to
such
research
,
scientists
have
said
transplanting
such
tissue
could
be
effective
in
treating
diabetes
.

BancOklahoma
Corp.
said
it
completed
a
restructuring
agreement
previously
agreed
to
by
the
Federal
Deposit
Insurance
Corp.
,
creditor
banks
and
subordinated
debenture
holders
.

The
plan
would
permit
the
bank
holding
company
to
retire
its
bank
and
debenture
obligations
through
exchanges
of
cash
and
equity
.

The
FDIC
,
which
in
1986
provided
$
130
million
in
open-bank
assistance
to
BancOklahoma
's
Bank
of
Oklahoma
,
Tulsa
,
unit
will
continue
to
maintain
$
90
million
in
preferred
stock
in
the
Tulsa
bank
unit
.

In
exchange
for
the
other
$
40
million
,
the
FDIC
will
receive
additional
warrants
entitling
it
to
buy
60
%
of
BancOklahoma
's
common
stock
outstanding
,
up
from
the
55
%
option

the
FDIC
received
under
terms
of
the
1986
capital
infusion
.

In
exchange
for
the
$
76
million

they
are
owed
,
creditor
banks
will
receive
3.9
million
shares
of
BancOklahoma
common
stock
and
the
proceeds
from
the
future
sales
of
four
subsidiary
banks
to
private
buyers
,
the
bank
holding
company
said
.

Also
under
the
agreement
,
debenture
holders
will
get
one
million
shares
of
common
stock
in
exchange
for
$
7.7
million
in
debentures
and
holders
of
BancOklahoma
's
series

A
preferred
stock
will
receive
1.25
shares
of
common
stock
for
every
share
of
preferred
they
own

LIN
Broadcasting
Corp.
said
it
wo
n't
take
a
position
on
a
revised
tender
offer
by
McCaw
Cellular
Communications
Inc.
to
buy
LIN
and
has
asked
for
clarification
of
the
offer
.

The
new
offer
,
which
seeks
50.3
%
of
the
cellular
and
broadcasting
concern
,
is
for
$
125

a
share
for
22
million
LIN
shares
.

McCaw
's
revised
tender
offer
would
require
McCaw
to
begin
an
auction
process
in
July
1994

that
would
buy
out
remaining
holders
at
a
per-share
price
roughly
equivalent
to
what

a
third
party
might
then
have
to
pay
for
all
of
LIN
.

LIN
is
asking
McCaw
to
clarify
its
tender
offer
,
which
challenges
an
agreement
between
BellSouth
Corp.
and
LIN
to
merge
their
cellular-telephone
businesses
.

BellSouth
has
notified
LIN
that
it
would
``
shortly
respond
to
the
McCaw
proposal
in
as
full
and
effective

a
manner
as
is
warranted
.

''

The
LIN
board
said
holders
may
be
misled
by
the
provision
in
the
McCaw
proposal
that
``
guarantees
''
private
market
value
after
five
years
for
the
remaining
shares
.

McCaw
has
``
no
obligation
to
purchase
and
the
definition
of
private
market
value
is
uncertain
,
''
the
LIN
board
said
.

The
board
added
that
McCaw
would
be
able
to
control
LIN
's
operations
and
could
,
``
therefore
,
operate
LIN
in
a
manner

which
could
diminish
its
private
market
value
and
attractiveness
to
a
third-party
purchaser
in
five
years
.

''

In
national
over-the-counter
trading
,
LIN
closed
at
$
104.75
,
down
$
2.75
.

U.S.
Trade
Representative
Carla
Hills
said
the
first
dispute-settlement
panel
set
up
under
the
U.S.-Canadian
``
free
trade
''
agreement
has
ruled
that
Canada
's
restrictions
on
exports
of
Pacific
salmon
and
herring
violate
the
accord
.

Mrs.
Hills
said
the
U.S.
and
Canada
have
until
Nov.
13
to
resolve
the
dispute
.

If
a
solution
is
n't
reached
by
then
,
she
said
,
the
U.S.
would
have
the
right
to
suspend
some
trade
concessions
to
Canada
equivalent
in
value
to
the
losses
suffered
by
U.S.
fish-processing
companies
in
Alaska
and
the
Pacific
Northwest
.

However
,
in
Ottawa
,
Canadian
Trade
Minister
John
Crosbie
said
the
dispute-settlement
panel
accepted
the
``
legitimacy
of
Canada
's
position
on
the
use
of
these
landing
requirements
to
conserve
and
manage
these
important
fisheries
.

''

Questioned
about
the
seeming
contradiction
in
the
U.S.
and
Canadian
government
views
of
the
panel
's
report
,
an
aide
for
Mrs.
Hills
said
the
panel
had
clearly
ruled
that
the
Canadian
trade
restrictions
``
are
illegal
.

''

The
U.S.
trade
representative
declined
to
put
a
dollar
estimate
on
the
losses
resulting
from
the
Canadian
export
restrictions
.

Canada
initially
had
an
export
prohibition

that
was
replaced
by
regulations
requiring
that
such
fish
had
to
be
brought
ashore
in
British
Columbia
by
commercial
fishermen
prior
to
export
.

This
action
was
defended
by
the
Canadian
government
on
conservation
grounds
.

Mrs.
Hills
said
yesterday
that
the
dispute-settlement
panel
rejected
this
Canadian
government
argument
.

``
We
fully
expect
that
Canada
will
comply
with
the
panel
's
ruling
''
that
the
``
landing
requirement
''
also
must
be
ended
,
she
said
.

Earlier
,
an
international
panel
set
up
under
the
rules
of
the
General
Agreement
on
Tariffs
and
Trade
in
Geneva
determined
that
the
original
Canadian
fish-export
restrictions
violated
GATT
rules
.

Mrs.
Hills
said
the
U.S.
wo
n't
accept
any
delays
after
Nov.
13
because
U.S.
fish-processing
firms
enter
into
contracts
in
the
fall
to
purchase
the
next
season
's
catch
.

She
said
the
Canadian
restrictions
must
be
removed
before
such
contracts
are
concluded
.

Golden
West
Financial
Corp.
,
riding
above
the
turbulence

that
has
troubled
most
of
the
thrift
industry
,
posted
a
16
%
increase
of
third-quarter
earnings
to
$
41.8
millon
,
or
66
cents

a
share
.

The
company
earned
$
36
million
,
or
57
cents

a
share
,
in
the
year-ago
quarter
.

Herbert
M.
Sandler
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
Oakland
,
Calif.
,
savings-and-loan
holding
company
,
credited
the
high
number
of
loans
added
to
the
company
's
portfolio
over
the
last
12
months
for
broadening
its
earning
asset
base
and
improving
profit
performance
.

However
,
the
executive
noted
that
slackening
demand
for
new
mortgages
depressed
new
loan
originations
to
$
1
billion
,
30
%
below
the
same
period
last
year
.

In
savings
activity
,
Mr.
Sandler
said
consumer
deposits
have
enjoyed
a
steady
increase
throughout
1989
,
and
topped
$
11
billion
at
quarter
's
end
for
the
first
time
in
the
company
's
history
.

Deposit
growth
amounted
to
$
393
million
,
more
than
double
the
year-ago
figure
.

Yesterday
was
,
in
the
words
of
New
York
Stock
Exchange
Chairman
John
J.
Phelan
Jr.
,
just
your
``
reasonably
normal
,
400
million-share
,
up
88-points
day
.

''

When
it
was
all
over
and
stocks
had
staged
a
huge
recovery
,
Big
Board
officials
were
self-congratulatory
about
how
well
the
day
had
gone
.

They
said
the
exchange
's
trading
procedures
,
personnel
,
equipment
and
links
with
other
exchanges
could
n't
have
performed
better
.

``
We
had
no
operating
problems
at
all
,
''
Mr.
Phelan
said
after
the
market
closed
.

``
All
the
things
that
we
set
up
to
slow
down
the
process
,
to
let
people
know
that
the
market
was
in
an
extreme
position
,
worked
extremely
well
.

''

Prices
for
the
416.3
million
shares

that
changed
hands
during
the
session
were
carried
on
the
exchange
's
trading
tape
with
barely
a
delay
,
officials
said
.

While
reaching
blockbuster
proportions
yesterday
,
the
volume
was
still
well
within
the
600
million-share
capacity
that
the
exchange
has
said
it
can
handle
daily
since
beefing
up
its
computers
after
the
October
1987
crash
.

The
so-called
circuit
breakers
devised
by
the
Big
Board
and
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
to
quell
free
falls
in
stock
and
futures
prices
were
n't
triggered
yesterday
because
the
markets
were
higher
for
most
of
the
day
.

Despite
traders
'
complaints
,
Mr.
Phelan
said
the
links
with
the
Chicago
futures
market
worked
as
planned
in
Friday
's
rout
to
provide
a
cooling-off
period
.

Of
greater
help
,
the
Big
Board
chairman
said
,
was
the
``
natural
circuit
breaker
''
of
the
weekend
,
that
provided
a
breathing
period
that
``
brought
rationality
back
to
the
market
.

''


For
the
moment
,
at
least
,
euphoria
has
replaced
anxiety
on
Wall
Street
.

The
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
jumped
sharply
yesterday
to
close
at
2657.38
,
panic
did
n't
sweep
the
world
's
markets
,
and
investors
large
and
small
seemed
to
accept
Friday
's
dizzying
190-point
plunge
as
a
sharp
correction
,
not
a
calamity
.

Many
went
bargain-hunting
.

Among
those
sighing
with
relief
was
John
H.
Gutfreund
,
chairman
of
Salomon
Brothers
,
who
took
to
the
firm
's
trading
floor
to
monitor
yesterday
's
events
.

As
the
rally
gained
strength
at
3:15
p.m.
,
he
smiled
broadly
,
brandished
his
unlit
cigar
and
slapped
Stanley
Shopkorn
,
his
top
stock
trader
,
on
the
back
.

At
first
,
it
seemed
as
if
history
might
repeat
itself
.

As
trading
opened
yesterday
morning
on
the
Big
Board
,
stocks
of
many
of
the
nation
's
biggest
companies
could
n't
open
for
trading
because
a
wave
of
sell
orders
was
overwhelming
buyers
.

By
10:10
,
the
Dow
Industrials
were
off
63.52
points
,
and
the
stock
of
UAL
Corp.
,
whose
troubles
had
kicked
off
Friday
's
plunge
,
still
had
n't
opened
.

But
then
,
as
quickly
as
the
Dow
had
fallen
,
it
began
to
turn
around
.

It
ended
with
a
gain
of
88.12
points
.

By
the
market
's
close
,
volume
on
the
New
York
exchange
totaled
more
than
416
million
,
the
fourth
highest
on
record
.

The
Big
Board
handled
the
huge
volume
without
any
obvious
strain
,
in
sharp
contrast
to
Black
Monday
of
1987
.

But
the
rally
was
largely
confined
to
the
blue-chip
stocks
,
which
had
been
hard
hit
during
Friday
's
selling
frenzy
.

Overall
,
more
Big
Board
stocks
lost
money
than
gained
.

And
many
arbitragers
,
already
reeling
from
Friday
's
collapse
of
the
UAL
deal
,
were
further
hurt
yesterday
when
a
proposed
takeover
of
AMR
Corp.
,
the
parent
of
American
Airlines
,
collapsed
.

Indeed
,
the
Dow
Jones
Transportation
Average
plunged
102.06
points
,
its
second-worst
drop
in
history
.

World-wide
,
trading
was
generally
manageable
.

The
Frankfurt
stock
exchange
was
hardest
hit
of
the
major
markets
,
with
blue
chips
there
falling
12.8
%
.

In
London
,
a
midday
rally
left
the
market
's
major
index
off
3.2
%
,
and
Tokyo
's
leading
stock
index
fell
only
1.8
%
in
surprisingly
lackluster
trading
.

Other
,
more
thinly
traded
Asian
markets
were
hit
harder
than
Tokyo
's
,
but
there
were
no
free-fall
declines
.

Investors
big
and
small
say
they
learned
valuable
lessons
since
the
1987
crash
:
In
this
age
of
computerized
trading
,
huge
corrections
or
runups
in
a
few
hours
'
time
must
be
expected
.

What
's
more
,
such
short-term
cataclysms
are
survivable
and
are
no
cause
for
panic
selling
.

Stephen
Boesel
,
a
major
money
manager
for
T.
Rowe
Price
in
Baltimore
,
says
,
``
There
was
less
panic
than
in
1987
:
We
had
been
through
it
once
.

''
In
Somerset
,
Wis.
,
Adrian
Sween
,
who
owns
a
supplier
of
nursing-home
equipment
and
is
n't
active
in
the
stock
market
,
agrees
.

``
I
look
at
it
as
a
ho-hum
matter
,
''
he
says
.

Many
other
factors
played
a
part
in
yesterday
's
comeback
.

The
Federal
Reserve
signaled
its
willingness
to
provide
liquidity
;
the
interest
rate
on
its
loans
to
major
banks
inched
downward
early
in
the
day
.

Foreign
stock
markets
,
which
kicked
off
Black
Monday
with
a
huge
selling
spree
,
began
the
day
off
by
relatively
modest
amounts
.

The
dollar
,
after
falling
sharply
in
overnight
trading
to
139.10
yen
,
bounced
back
strongly
to
141.8
,
thus
easing
fears
that
foreigners
would
unload
U.S.
stocks
.

And
the
widely
disseminated
opinion
among
most
market
experts
that
a
crash
was
n't
in
store
also
helped
calm
investors
.

Many
major
institutions
,
for
example
,
came
into
work
yesterday
ready
to
buy
some
of
the
blue
chips
they
felt
had
been
sharply
undervalued
on
Friday
.

Still
,
amid
all
the
backslapping
and
signs
of
relief
over
yesterday
's
events
,
some
market
professionals
cautioned
that
there
is
nothing
present
in
the
current
market
system
to
prevent
another
dizzying
drop
such
as
Friday
's
.

``
There
is
too
much
complacency
,
''
says
money
manager
Barry
Schrager
.

Computers
have
increasingly
connected
securities
markets
world-wide
,
so
that
a
buying
or
selling
wave
in
one
market
is
often
passed
around
the
globe
.

So
investors
everywhere
nervously
eyed
yesterday
's
opening
in
Tokyo
,
where
the
Nikkei
average
of
225
blue-chip
stocks
got
off
to
a
rocky
start
.

The
average
plunged
some
600
points
,
or
1.7
%
,
in
the
first
20
minutes
of
trading
.

But
the
selling
wave
had
no
conviction
,
and
the
market
first
surged
upward
by
200
points
,
then
drifted
lower
,
closing
down
647
.

Unlike
two
years
ago
,
most
of
Japan
's
major
investors
chose
to
sit
this
calamity
out
.

In
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
's
Tokyo
trading
room
,
some
40
traders
and
assistants
sat
quietly
,
with
few
orders
to
process
.

Clients
``
are
all
staying
out
''
of
the
market
,
one
Merrill
trader
says
.

The
relative
calm
in
Tokyo
proved
little
comfort
to
markets
opening
up
in
Europe
.

Frankfurt
's
opening
was
delayed
a
half
hour
because
of
a
crush
of
sell
orders
.

``
The
beginning
was
chaotic
,
''
says
Nigel
Longley
,
a
broker
for
Commerzbank

In
London
,
the
view
from
the
trading
floor
of
an
American
securities
firm
,
Jefferies
&
Co.
,
also
was
troubling
.

A
computer
screen
displaying
100
blue-chip
stocks
colors

each

one
red
when
its
price
is
falling
.

The
screen
was
a
sea
of
red
.

``
I
see
concern
,
but
I
do
n't
see
panic
,
''
says
J.
Francis
Palamara
,
a
New
Yorker

who
runs
the
15-trader
office
.

London
's
blue-chip
stock
index
turned
up
just
before
8
a.m
.

New
York
time
,
sending
an
encouraging
message
to
Wall
Street
.

When
trading
opened
in
New
York
at
9:30
a.m.
EDT
,
stocks
fell
sharply
--
as
expected
.

Futures
markets
in
Chicago
had
opened
at
a
level
suggesting
the
Dow
would
fall
by
about
60
points
.

With
sell
orders
piled
up
from
Friday
,
about
half
the
stocks
in
the
Dow
could
n't
open
on
time
.

By
9:45
,
the
industrial
average
had
dropped
27
points
.

By
10
a.m.
,
it
was
down
49
.

Ten
minutes
later
,
the
Dow
hit
bottom
-
down
63.52
points
,
another
2.5
%
.

But
shortly
before
then
,
some
of
Wall
Street
's
sharpest
traders
say
,
they
sensed
a
turn
.

``
The
first
thing

that
caught
my
eye

that
was
encouraging
was
Treasury
bonds
were
off
,
''
says
Austin
George
,
head
of
stock
trading
at
T.
Rowe
Price
.

``
It
meant
that
people
were
n't
running
pell-mell
to
the
safety
of
bonds
.

''

Shortly
after
10
a.m.
,
the
Major
Market
Index
,
a
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
futures
contract
of
20
stocks
designed
to
mimic
the
DJIA
,
exploded
upward
.

Stock
traders
were
buoyed
--
because
an
upturn
in
the
MMI
had
also
started
the
recovery
in
stocks
on
the
Tuesday
following
Black
Monday
.

``
The
MMI
has
gone
better
,
''
shouted
a
trader
in
the
London
office
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
.

Shearson
's
London
trading
room
went
wild
.

Traders
shouted
out
as
their
Reuters
,
Quotron
and
Telerate
screens
posted
an
ever-narrowing
loss
on
Wall
Street
.

Then
,
nine
minutes
later
,
Wall
Street
suddenly
rebounded
to
a
gain
on
the
day
.

``
Rally
,
rally
,
rally
,
''
shouted
Shearson
's
Andy
Rosen
.

``
This
is
panic
buying
.

''
Major
blue-chip
stocks
like
Philip
Morris
,
General
Motors
and
Proctor
&
Gamble
led
the
rally
.

Japanese
were
said
to
be
heavy
buyers
.

German
and
Dutch
investors
reportedly
loaded
up
on
Kellogg
Co
.

Then
,
traders
say
,
corporations
with
share
buy-back
programs
kicked
into
high
gear
,
triggering
gains
in
,
among
other
issues
,
Alcan
Aluminium
and
McDonald
's
.

Walt
Disney
Co.
,
which
had
one
of
the
biggest
sell-order
imbalances
on
Friday
and
was
one
of
seven
stocks

that
halted
trading
and
never
reopened
that
day
,
opened
yesterday
late
at
114.5
,
down
8.5
.

But
then
it
suddenly
burst
upward
7.5
as
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
stepped
in
and
bought
almost
every
share
offer
,
traders
said
.

By
10:25
,
the
Dow
had
turned
up
for
the
day
,
prompting
cheers
on
trading
desks
and
exchange
floors
.

Among
Big
Board
specialists
,
the
cry
was
``
Pull
your
offers
''
--
meaning
that
specialists
soon
expected
to
get
higher
prices
for
their
shares
.

``
It
was
bedlam
on
the
upside
,
''
said
one
Big
Board
specialist
.

``
What

we
had
was
a
real
,
old-fashioned
rally
.

''

This
technical
strength
spurred
buying
from
Wall
Street
's
``
black
boxes
,
''
computer
programs
designed
to
trigger
large
stock
purchases
during
bullish
periods
.

Typical
,
perhaps
,
was
Batterymarch
's
Dean
LeBaron
.

Mr.
LeBaron
,
who
manages
$
10
billion
,
says
,
``
We
turned
the
trading
system
on
,
and
it
did
whatever

it
was
programmed
to
do
.

''
Asked
what
stocks
the
computer
bought
,
the
money
manager
says
,
``
I
do
n't
know
.

''

Not
everybody
was
making
money
.

The
carnage
on
the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
,
the
nation
's
major
options
market
,
was
heavy
after
the
trading
in
S&P
100
stock-index
options
was
halted
Friday
.

Many
market
makers
in
the
S&P
100
index
options
contract
had
bullish
positions
Friday
,
and
when
the
shutdown
came
they
were
frozen
with
huge
losses
.

Over
the
weekend
,
clearing
firms
told
the
Chicago
market
makers
to
get
out
of
their
positions
at
any
cost
Monday
morning
.

``
They
were
absolutely
killed
,
slaughtered
,
''
said
one
Chicago-based
options
trader
.

Meanwhile
,
a
test
of
the
stock
market
's
rally
came
at
about
2
p.m.
,
with
the
Dow
at
2600
,
up
31
points
on
the
day
.

Charles
Clough
,
a
strategist
at
Merrill
Lynch
,
says
bargain
hunting
had
explained
the
Dow
's
strength
up
to
that
point
and
that
many
market
professionals
were
anticipating
a
drop
in
the
Dow
.

Moreover
,
the
announcement
that
real
estate
magnate
and
sometime
raider
Donald
Trump
was
withdrawing
his
offer
for
AMR
Corp.
might
have
been
expected
to
rattle
traders
.

Instead
,
the
rally
only
paused
for
about
25
minutes
and
then
steamed
forward
as
institutions
resumed
buying
.

The
market
closed
minutes
after
reaching
its
high
for
the
day
of

Across
the
country
,
many
people
took
yesterday
's
events
in
stride
,
while
remaining
generally
uneasy
about
the
stock
market
in
general
.

Says
James
Norman
,
the
mayor
of
Ava
,
Mo.
:
``
I
do
n't
invest
in
stocks
.

I
much
prefer
money

I
can
put
my
hands
on
.

''
While
Mayor
Norman
found
the
market
's
performance
Monday
reassuring
,
he
says
,
he
remains
uneasy
.

``
We
have
half
the
experts
saying
one
thing
and
half
the
other
''
about
the
course
of
the
economy
.

Ralph
Holzfaster
,
a
farmer
and
farm-supply
store
operator
in
Ogallala
,
Neb.
,
says
of
the
last
few
days
events
,
``
If
anything
good
comes
out
of
this
,
it
might
be
that
it
puts
some
of
these
LBOs
on
the
skids
.

''

Says
Gordon
Fines
,
a
money
manager
at
IDS
Financial
Services
in
Minneapolis
,
``
You
're
on
a
roller
coaster

Frank
Lloyd
Wright
is
reported
to
have
said
once
that
if
you
tipped
the
world
on
its
side
,
everything
loose
would
end
up
in
California
.

We
've
always
thought
that
Mr.
Wright
underestimated
California
's
vitality
,
but
maybe
the
state
's
la-la
factions
are
starting
to
overwhelm
the
forces

that
made
it
such
a
significant
place
.

What
else
is
one
to
make
of
the
whacky
save-the-earth
initiative
just
proposed
by
several
major
environmental
groups
and
organized
by
the
state
's
attorney
general
?

If
passed
by
the
voters
,
the
recently
announced
initiative
would
phase
out
major
pesticides
,
reduce
carbon
dioxide
emissions
by
40
%
,
ban
new
offshore
drilling
,
ban
chemicals
thought
to
deplete
the
ozone
layer
,
and
create
a
new
state
environmental
officer
armed
with
a
$
40
million
budget
to
sue
any
firm
or
agency

he
thinks
is
being
too
dirty
.

The
initiative
is
based
largely
on
the
wish-lists
of
the
green
lobby
:
the
Sierra
Club
,
the
League
of
Conservation
Voters
,
the
Natural
Resources
Defense
Council
,
the
National
Toxics
Campaign
and
the
Citizens
for
a
Better
Environment
.

Interestingly
,
the
Environmental
Defense
Fund
is
having
nothing
to
do
with
this
one
.

Not
only
Californians
but
all
Americans
would
pay
if
this
thing
passed
.

The
initiative
bars
the
sale
of
any
crops
in
California

that
do
n't
meet
the
initiative
's
standards
.

Kansas
wheat
farmers
and
Florida
fruit
growers
would
have
to
adjust
or
give
up
the
California
market
.

In
other
words
,
California
is
presuming
to
take
control
of
the
nation
's
farm
policy
.

As
usual
the
green
lobby
's
proposal
is
disconnected
from
scientific
reality
.

Consider
the
greenhouse-effect
provision
.

The
proposed
initiative
would
mandate
a
reduction
of
carbon
dioxide
of
40
%
.

Even
if
one
buys
into
the
whole
greenhouse
theory
,
it
is
inconceivable
that
reductions
in
a
single
state
could
have
any
impact
on
what
is
billed
as
a
global
problem
.

But
if
rational
science
and
economics
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
new
environment
initiative
,
what
is
going
on
?

The
first
place
to
look
under
these
circumstances
is
at
the
ways
in
which

the
sponsors
themselves
will
benefit
.

The
key
here
is
the
ambition
of
state
Attorney
General
John
Van
de
Kamp
.

He
's
running
for
governor
.

Mr.
Van
de
Kamp
is
the
one

who
collected
the
plans
from
the
various
radical
environmental
groups
and
cobbled
them
into
a
single
unwieldy
initiative
to
be
placed
on
the
ballot
for
election
on
Nov.
6
,
1990
.

That
's
also
the
day
of
the
gubernatorial
election
.

The
initiative
seems
to
have
been
crafted
to
include
all
the
hot
issues

that
set
off
the
wealthy
Hollywood
weepers

who
donate
money
.

And
it
allows
Mr.
Van
de
Kamp
to
get
around
campaign
spending
limits
.

He
can
spend
the
legal
maximum
for
his
campaign
;
all
the
spending
for
the
Van
de
Kamp
initiative
(
on
which
there
are
no
limits
)
is
gravy
.

This
initiative
is
being
labeled
The
Big
Green
,
but
maybe
it
should
be
called
The
Big
Greenback
.

(
The
Republican
candidate
,
Sen.
Pete
Wilson
,
is
playing
the
initiative
fundraising
game
too
,
sponsoring
his
own
crime
initiative
.

)

While
it
is
possible
that
the
Big
Green
initiative
will
be
ruled
unconstitutional
,
it
is
of
course
conceivable
that
in
modern
California

it
could
slide
through
.

This
is
the
state

that
recently
passed
the
Prop.
65
anti-toxic
initiative
.

If
this
new
proposal
ever
does
become
law
,
the
green
lobby
will
benefit
directly
.

The
initiative
creates
a
free
floating
state
environmental
officer
to
sue
companies
or
government
agencies

that
do
things

he
does
n't
like
.

That
means
the
NRDC
and
such
groups
no
longer
would
have
to
spend
as
much
money
on
litigation
;
taxpayers
would
bear
the
cost
.

Mr.
Van
de
Kamp
and
his
allies
may
be
hoping
that
the
environment
is
such
a
mom
and
apple-pie
issue
among
certain
segments
of
California
's
population
now
that
almost
any
collection
of
anti-scientific
,
anti-pocketbook
nonsense
can
pass
under
its
rubric
.

Of
course

the
state
's
liberals
are
not
yet
a
nation
unto
themselves
.

George
Bush
,
for
example
,
may
decide
that
he
does
n't
want
to
be
the
President

who
lost
control
of
interstate
commerce
to
an
attorney
general
from
California
.

And
some
other
segments
of
California
's
political
and
media
culture
may
yet
start
to
point
out
that
the
initiative
would
impose
significant
costs
on
the
state
's
less
affluent
citizens
in
the
form
of
higher
food
prices
and
lost
jobs
.

This
grandiose
initiative
will
help
California
define
itself
for
the
future
either
as
a
state
still
tethered
to
economic
and
scientific
reality
,
or
as
one
being
led
to
wherever
its
la-la
activists
want
to
take
it
.

BMA

said
it
's
weighing
``
strategic
alternatives

''
for
its
Business
Men
's
Assurance
Co.
unit
,
and
is
contacting
possible
buyers
of
the
life
and
health
insurance
operation
.

A
BMA
spokesman
said
``
runaway
medical
costs
''
have
made
health
insurance
``
a
significant
challenge
,
''
and
margins
also
have
been
pinched
by
changes
in
the
mix
of
life-insurance
products
consumers
now
demand
.

The
Business
Men
's
Assurance
unit
represented
about
$
288
million
of
the
company
's
$
488
million
in
1988
revenue
,
and
the
unit
's
operating
income
was
about

10
million

said
the
spokesman
.

From
the
professional
money
manager
to
the
big
overseas
currency
player
to
the
little
guy
with
his
IRA
in
a
mutual
fund
,
the
bulletin
from
Wall
Street
came
as
a
shock
--
followed
swiftly
by
a
sickening
recollection
of
the
pattern
played
out
in
the
'87
crash
:
a
100-point-plus
plunge
on
a
Friday
,
a
weekend
of
worrying
in
between
,
and
then
disaster
on
Monday
.

Who
could
be
blamed
for
wondering
if
it
is
all
happening
again
,
in
another
nervous
October
?

``
It
's
scaring
the
hell
out
of
me
,
''
says
Tom
Loughlin
,
a
systems
analyst
and
small
investor
in
Boston
.

Friday
's
events
demonstrate
that
despite
all
the
post-1987
studies
and
reforms
,
the
stock
market
can
still
plunge
with
dizzying
steepness
.

The
190.58-point
drop
was
the
second-largest
in
magnitude
ever
,
and
the
12th
worst
on
a
percentage
basis
.

But
what
was
most
terrifying
was
its
speed
:
The
market
dropped
154
points
in
only
65
minutes
,
pausing
only
as
the
close
neared
.

Moreover
,
this
plunge
came
in
a
time
of
relatively
benign
economic
conditions
,
raising
the
question
of
how
the
markets
might
react
when
a
serious
economic
upset
,
such
as
a
recession
,
is
on
the
horizon
.

But
despite
its
hair-trigger
edginess
,
whether
the
market
today
will
in
fact
mirror
1987
with
a
further
dive
is
a
far
different
matter
.

There
are
many
reasons
to
think
that
what
appeared
Friday
is
another
species
of
bear
,
and
a
less
vicious
one
.

The
reasons
include
the
obvious
differences
in
the
market
between
this
fall
and
1987
:
Interest
rates
have
n't
been
rising
this
time
,
as
they
were
in
1987
;
the
dollar
,
though
hit
Friday
,
has
n't
been
eroding
dangerously
;
the
economy
is
n't
overheating
;
and
,
above
all
,
stocks
are
far
from
being
as
wildly
overpriced
:
They
are
selling
at
only
about
13
times
per-share
earnings
,
compared
with
about
20
two
years
ago
.

And
this
time
,
the
regulators
are
moving
with
more
dispatch
.

The
Federal
Reserve
has
already
indicated
that
it
will
provide
the
credit
needed
to
see
that
there
is
n't
a
liquidity
squeeze
today
.

Many
traders
think
the
Fed
will
quickly
lower
interest
rates
,
a
move

that
would
be
a
plus
for
stocks
.

--
The
levels
of
selling
of
U.S
and
foreign
stocks
in
Asian
and
European
markets
,
which
open
well
before
New
York
's
.

In
early
trading
in
Tokyo
Monday
,
share
prices
fell
1.7
%
.

After
the
initial
slide
,
the
market
appeared
to
be
turning
around
but
by
early
afternoon
was
headed
lower
.

--
Whether
the
buy-out
of
United
Airlines
parent
UAL
Corp.
,
whose
financing
failure
triggered
Friday
's
free
fall
,
can
be
put
back
together
.

Late
yesterday
,
it

was
n't
clear
the
buyers
could
make
a
new
bid
by
today
.

The
lower
UAL
opens
,
the
more
traders

who
've
bought
with
borrowed
money
will
have
to
sell
UAL
and
other
takeover
stocks
to
meet
margin
calls
.

--
The
levels
of
early
stock-index
futures
trading
in
Chicago
.

That
market
shut
down
early
on
Friday
,
leaving
millions
of
dollars
of
sell
orders
unexecuted
.

Heavy
index-futures
selling
often
pulls
the
stock
market
down
.

--
The
pressures
on
mutual-fund
companies
to
sell
stock
in
order
to
meet
demands
from
customers
for
redemptions
.

On
Black
Monday
,
some
funds
sold
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
stocks
after
being
inundated
with
redemptions
.

But
late
yesterday
,
the
biggest
fund
group
,
Fidelity
Investments
,
said
this
weekend
's
redemptions
were
running
at
under
one-third

the
level
before
Oct.
19
,
1987
.

--
Any
action
by
the
Federal
Reserve
.

Any
move
to
lower
interest
rates
,
for
example
,
would
be
a
positive
for
stocks
,
by
making
fixed-income
investments
less
competitive
with
them
.

Much
as
in
the
1987
crash
,
the
spark

that
lit
the
fuse
on
Friday
was
a
news
announcement
that
,
at
first
blush
,
seemed
to
have
little
bearing
on
the
market
as
a
whole
.

When
the
UAL
buy-out
group
said
it
could
n't
get
bank
financing
for
its
$
6.79
billion
deal
,
the
announcement
sent
takeover-stock
traders
scrambling
to
sell
United
,
other
airline
stocks
and
then
other
real
or
rumored
takeover
stocks
.

The
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
futures
took
only
15
minutes
from
the
UAL
announcement
,
at
2:54
p.m.
,
to
hit
their
first
``
circuit
breaker
,
''
a
30-minute
trading
halt

that
kicks
in
when
the
futures
drop
the
equivalent
of
100
points
on
the
Dow
.

When
the
futures
reopened
at
3:30
,
it
took
only
15
minutes
more
for
them
to
hit
the
next
100-point-equivalency
limit
,
when
S&P
trading
halted
for
the
day
.

At
the
stock
market
's
4
p.m.
close
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
average
was
withing
60
points
of
another
circuit
breaker
.

Had
the
Dow
fallen
250
points
,
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
would
have
been
halted
for
an
hour
.

Many
investors
say
the
circuit
breakers
,
instituted
following
the
1987
collapse
,
provided
little
reassurance
.

One
Big
Board
specialist
complains
that
the
Friday
futures
halt
,
which
was
supposed
to
give
the
markets
time
to
regain
their
equilibrium
because
futures
prices
are
reported
faster
,
was
``
ridiculous
;
anything

artificial

that
gets
in
the
way
of
this
market
is
very
hard
to
work
with
.

''
Some
traders
fear
circuit
breakers
hold
the
risk
of
making
matters
worse
,
especially
if
they
should
halt
stock
trading
.

But
Big
Board
Chairman
John
J.
Phelan
Jr.
maintains
that
the
safeguards
were
a
success
Friday
.

There
were
also
complaints
that
the
specialists
on
the
floor
of
the
Big
Board
,
who
are
charged
with
making
markets
in
individual
stocks
,
performed
poorly
during
the
plunge
.

Trading
was
halted
in
10
stocks
when
specialists
could
n't
balance
buy
and
sell
orders
in
some
stocks
,
such
as
entertainment
giant
Walt
Disney
Co
.

Seven
never
reopened
.

One
futures
executive
,
Christopher
Pedersen
of
Twenty-First
Securities
Corp.
,
says
the
specialists
``
were
not
able
to
handle
the
imbalances
on
the
floor
of
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

''
But
James
Maguire
,
chairman
of
Henderson
Brothers
Inc.
,
a
Big
Board
specialist
,
retorts
:
``
It
is
easy
to
say
the
specialist
is
n't
doing
his
job
.

When
the
dollar
is
in
free
fall
,
even
central
banks
ca
n't
stop
it
.

''

One
of
the
most
puzzling
aspects
of
Friday
's
drop
was
the
speed
with
which

the
damage
to
UAL
spilled
over
to
other
stocks
.

Market
professionals
say
that
major
arbitragers
and
others
such
as
hedge
funds
,
which
were
heavily
invested
in
UAL
and
highly
leveraged
,
could
n't
get
any
cash
out
of
their
UAL
positions
because
trading
halted
.

Once
UAL
were
to
reopen
,
such
speculators
faced
the
likelihood
of
margin
calls
--
demands
from
lenders
to
put
up
more
cash
for
stock
positions
bought
with
borrowed
funds
.

So
such
traders
quickly
tried
to
raise
cash
by
selling
other
so-called
deal
stocks
,
like
AMR
(
American
Airlines
)
and
USAir
.

But
then
trading
was
halted
because
of
order
imbalances
--
there
were
far
more
sellers
than
buyers
.

So
the
``
arbs
''
started
dumping
positions
in
their
entire
portfolios
,
including
major
blue-chip
stocks

that
have
had
large
price
runups

this
year
,
in
a
desperate
race
for
cash
.

AMR
,
subject
of
a
$
120-a-share
bid
from
Donald
Trump
,
saw
trading
in
its
stock
halted
at
$
98.625

a
share
,
down
$
.125
,
but
was
quoted
in
off-exchange
trading
at
only
$
81.50
.

Paramount
Communications
Inc.
,
the
subject
of
takeover
whispers
,
plunged
$
6.625

a
share
to
$
56.625
.

Shares
of
Hilton
Hotels
Corp.
,
which
has
put
itself
up
for
sale
,
nosedived
$
21.50
to
$
85

a
share
.

The
deluge
left
some
investors
shaken
and
angry
.

``
Do
n't
ask
me
how
I
am
,
''
said
Marshall
Front
,
a
money
manager
at
Stein
Roe
&
Farnham
Inc.
in
Chicago
.

``
This
is
incredible
.

You
have
a
classic
panic
.

''

Frederick
A.
Moran
,
president
of
Moran
Asset
Management
in
Greenwich
,
Conn.
,
said
computer-aided
``
program
traders
are
the
reason

we
had
the
last
crash
,
they
're
the
reason

we
're
having
this
crash
,
and
they
're
why
we
'll
have
the
next
crash
.

They
're
a
total
outrage
.

''
Stephen
B.
Timbers
,
chief
investment
officer
of
Kemper
Financial
Services
Inc.
in
Chicago
,
agrees
that
none
of
Friday
's
events
by
themselves
added
up
to
a
190-point
decline
.

``
Programs
took
it
down
.

Without
the
programs
,
I
ca
n't
imagine
it
would
have
been
down
50
,
''
he
says
.

Many
market
professionals
say
it
is
still
too
soon
to
know
whether
it
was
program
traders
,
per
se
,
who
were
to
blame
,
but
they
generally
agree
that
the
computerized
trading
programs

that
have
now
been
embraced
by
an
array
of
professional
investors
and
money
managers
accounted
for
the
speed
of
the
drop
.

Traders
say
that
Friday
's
big
sellers
included
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
,
which
was
reportedly
executing
trades
for
a
client
switching
from
stocks
to
bonds
,
and
Tudor
Investments
,
a
prominent
player
in
the
futures
markets
.

Tudor
would
n't
comment
;
a
spokesman
for
Salomon
denied
that
it
was
a
heavy
seller
.

Michael
Steinhardt
,
who
only
last
Monday
was
threatening
a
takeover
of
USAir
using
his
8.4
%
stake
as
a
club
,
says
he
wished
he
did
n't
own
the
stock
when
Friday
's
market
left
him
with
a
$
12.9
million
paper
loss
.

``
This
market
is
a
mile
wide
and
an
inch
deep
,
''
he
says
.

But
Mr.
Steinhardt
disputed
that
he
had
been
a
heavy
seller
of
other
stocks
Friday
to
make
up
for
the
USAir
losses
.

Several
big
firms

that
do
index
arbitrage
,
in
which
traders
buy
and
sell
stocks
and
stock-index
futures
simultaneously
to
take
advantage
of
price
differentials
,
say
they
could
n't
execute
trades
because
they
could
n't
be
sure
of
prices
they
would
get
on
the
stock
exchange
floor
.

One
takeover
stock
speculator
says
that
with
individual
investors
frightened
away
from
the
market
,
the
remaining
participants
are
mainly
institutions
,
all
with
instant
access
to
the
same
information
,
and
the
same
ability
to
sell
in
an
instant
--
that
is
,
until
all
try
to
sell
at
once
.

``
If
this
is
something

that
had
happened
over
the
last
few
weeks
,
nobody
would
have
noticed
,
''
the
speculator
says
.

``
But
now
it
just
happens
in
an
hour
.

The
information
is
very
quick
;
it
's
often
inaccurate
;
and
reactions
can
be
irrational
.

''

The
speed
of
Friday
's
drop
is
likely
to
reinforce
the
perception
of
many
small
investors
that
the
markets
are
even
more
of
a
casino
and
have
n't
devised
a
manner
for
comfortably
handling
the
awesome
forces

that
technology
has
heaped
upon
them
.

Despite
two
years
of
study
,
the
marketplace
remains
one
where
ever-anxious
large
investors
,
haunted
by
memories
of
the
508-point
plunge
in
1987
and
aided
by
powerful
computers
,
can
turn
minor
market
upsets
into
major
calamities
in
the
space
of
a
few
hours
.

Many
are
quick
to
emphasize
that
just
because
the
market
can
fall
as
fast
as
it
did
Friday
does
n't
mean
it
will
tank
again
,
despite
some
disquieting
similarities
between
now
and
October
1987
.

As
in
1987
,
this
latest
market
slide
was
preceded
by
sparring
between
nations
and
government
officials
over
the
dollar
.

In
1987
,
then-Treasury
Secretary
James
Baker
was
threatening
a
big
drop
in
the
dollar
if
West
Germany
raised
interest
rates
.

This
year
,
Federal
Reserve
Chairman
Alan
Greenspan
seemed
to
warn
he
would
n't
lower
interest
rates
merely
to
keep
the
dollar
within
an
agreed-on
exchange
range
.

In
another
similarity
to
1987
,
the
government
was
threatening
a
crackdown
on
highly
leveraged
takeovers
.

Then
it
was
House
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Daniel
Rostenkowski
threatening
to
eliminate
the
tax
deductibility
of
interest
for
certain
debt-financed
takeovers
.

This
year

it
was
Transportation
Secretary
Samuel
Skinner
voicing
concern
about
airline
buy-outs
and
threatening
to
force
changes
in
the
United
deal
.

(
Some
think
another
Washington
factor

this
time
was
the
Senate
's
failure
to
pass
capital-gains
tax
cut
.

)

But
market
observers
point
out
that
long-term
government
bond
interest
rates
,
currently
at
7.85
%
,
are
2.5
percentage
points
lower
than
the
level

that
prevailed
in
October
1987
,
when
interest
rates
had
been
rising
for
most
of
the
year
.

Another
difference

this
year
is
that
stocks
'
price-earnings
ratios
are
much
lower
,
which
implies
that
they
may
not
be
so
overpriced
.

In
1987
,
the
average
P-E
ratio
fell
from
a
peak
of
more
than
20
to
about
13
just
after
the
crash
.

This
year
,
the
average
ratio
was
14
at
the
market
peak
one
week
ago
,
and
finished
Friday
at
13
.

On
the
other
hand
,
one
reason
those
ratios
were
so
high
in
1987
was
that
the
stock
market
had
been
anticipating
an
enormous
rise
in
corporate
earnings
,
which
did
in
fact
occur
.

Between
1987
and
1989
,
those
profits
were
projected
to
rise
by
50
%
.

But
now
those
earnings
are
hitting
a
plateau
.

Just
last
week

a
string
of
earnings
disappointments
unnerved
some
market
participants
.

Next
year
,
earnings
are
expected
to
inch
up
only
2.4
%
.

Another
factor

that
has
been
dominating
the
thinking
of
many
stock
analysts
is
the
current
plight
of
the
junk-bond
market
.

Although
UAL
,
the
second-largest
leveraged
buy-out
ever
,
was
to
have
been
financed
with
bank
debt
instead
of
junk
bonds
,
its
failure
to
obtain
financing
focused
attention
on
the
entire
market
for
leveraged
deals
,
underscoring
just
how
dependent
the
entire
market
has
become
on
junk
bonds
.

Many
stocks
owe
at
least
part
of
their
market
valuation
to
the
perception
that
they
could
soon
be
the
subject
of
a
takeover
or
buy-out
.

Attention
is
focused
on
the
so-called
breakup
value
of
the
stock
in
the
hands
of
an
imagined
acquirer

who
would
buy
the
company
at
a
big
premium
,
perhaps
planning
to
sell
it

piece
by
piece
.

Takeover
specialist
Carl
Icahn
,
whose

13.1
%
stake
in
USX
Corp.
lost
$
151.2
million
in
value
on
Friday
,
says
the
stock
market
's
downturn
may
reflect
the
end
of
a
speculative
period

that
has
generated
many
leveraged
buy-outs

that
now
face
problems
as
a
result
of
weakness
in
the
junk-bond
market
.

``
While
a
number
of
LBOs
are
fine
,
there
are
also
many
where
the
cash
flow
can
not
pay
the
interest
,
but
{
that
}
instead
are
based
on
the
buyer
selling
divisions
to
a
greater
fool
to
pay
off
the
debt
,
''
Mr.
Icahn
says
.

However
,
Mario
Gabelli
,
a
takeover-stock
investor
,
says
that
while
some
of
the
most
speculative
deals
may
now
prove
impossible
to
finance
,
``
Companies
are
still
going
to
buy
companies
around
the
world
.

''

As
on
any
day
on
Wall
Street
,
there
are
plenty
of
people

who
think
the
market
will
go
up
,
and
plenty

who
predict
a
downturn
.

``
My
advice
is
to
buy
,
''
says
Elaine
Garzarelli
,
a
market-timing
expert
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
,
who
warned
clients
of
danger
just
before
the
1987
crash
.

She
compares
the
current
drop-off
to
10%-12
%
corrections
in
1978
and
1979
.

And
Treasury
Secretary
Nicholas
Brady
says
the
market
's
drop
Friday
ought
to
be
seen
in
the
context
of
a
28.7
%
runup
in
the
Dow
since
Jan.
1
of
this
year
.

In
addition
,
the
stocks
as
a
whole
are
up
60
%
from
the
day
after
the
1987
crash
.

Since
the
market
hit
a
record
level
of
2791.41
on
Monday
,
it
has
declined
by
222.15
points
,
or
8
%
.

Most
of
that
occurred
on
Friday
.

Some
think
the
selling
has
a
way
to
go
.

James
Awad
,
president
of
BMI
Capital
Corp.
in
New
York
,
says
that
despite
the
more
favorable
valuation
levels
,
stocks
could
still
tumble
several
hundred
points
in
the
event
of
a
breakdown
in
``
the
internal
structure
of
the
market
.

''

Although
professionals
were
bracing
themselves
for
some
heavy
early
selling
on
overseas
markets
,
many
did
n't
detect
any
widespread
panic
over
the
weekend
among
U.S.
institutions
and
individual
investors
.

Many
mutual
funds
have
big
cash
reserves
--
which

they
lacked
in
1987
--
as
a
cushion
against
a
possible
cascade
of
telephone
sell
orders
today
.

Fidelity
,
which
was
forced
to
sell
$
800
million
of
stocks
in
the
1987
crash
,
has
quadrupled
the
cash
level
of
the
giant
Magellan
fund
.

The
Boston
firm
says
redemptions
in
stock
funds
since
the
Friday
market
drop
have
equaled
less
than
15
%
of
those
funds
'
total
cash
position
of
about
$
2
billion
.

``
Two
years
ago
there
were
massive
redemption
levels
over
the
weekend
and
a
lot
of
fear
around
,
''
says
C.
Bruce
Johnstone
,
who
runs
Fidelity
's
$
5
billion
Equity-Income
Fund
.

``
This
feels
more
like
a
one-shot
deal
--
people
are
n't
panicking
.

''

Liquidity
also
appears
to
be
far
healthier
than
it
was
in
1987
,
when
a
lack
of
it
brought
the
financial
system
close
to
break-down
.

Over
the
weekend
,
Federal
Reserve
Chairman
Greenspan
phoned
officials
in
the
U.S.
and
abroad
to
reassure
them
that
the
Fed
was
prepared
to
inject
massive
amounts
of
money
into
the
banking
system
if
needed
to
prevent
a
financial
crisis
.

And
Mr.
Phelan
,
the
Big
Board
's
chairman
,
says
that
the
exchange
has
n't
turned
up
any
capital
problems
among
its
49
specialist
firms
,
suggesting
that
the
Big
Board
will
have
the
capacity
to
make
orderly
markets
even
if
volume
is
heavy
.

Kysor
Industrial
Corp.
said
it
expects
its
third-quarter
net
earnings
to
be
between
two
cents
and
four
cents

a
share
,
compared
with
61
cents

a
share

a
year
ago
.

Analysts
had
been
projecting
that
the
company
's
earnings
would
be
between
25
cents
and
30
cents

a
share
.

The
year-earlier
third-quarter
earnings
amounted
to
$
4.1
million
.

The
company
said
a
drop
in
activity
in
the
powerboat
industry
reduced
sales
volume
at
its
two
marine-related
operations
.

Also
,
the
company
said
its
commercial
products
operation
failed
to
meet
forecasts
.

Kysor
,
a
maker
of
heavy-duty
truck
and
commercial
refrigeration
equipment
,
said
it
expects
its
fourth-quarter
earnings
to
be
more
closely
in
line
with
usual
levels
,
which
are
between
30
cents
and
50
cents

a
share
.

Apple
Computer
Inc.
said
it
will
offer
cash
rebates
on
several
of
its
machines
from
Oct.
14
to
Dec.
31.
,
as
part
of
a
holiday-season
sales
promotion
.

Apple
will
offer
a
$
150
rebate
on
its
Apple
IIGS
with
any
Apple
Monitor
and
disk
drive
;
$
200
on
the
basic
Macintosh
Plus
central
processing
unit
;
$
250
on
the
Macintosh
SE
central
processing
unit
;
$
250
on
the
Macintosh
cpu
,
and
$
300
on
a
Macintosh
IIcx
with
any
Apple
video
card
and
Apple
monitor
.

The
rebates
,
as
a
percentage
of
the
retail
cost
of
the
cpu
of
each
system
,
amount
to
6
%
to
13
%
.

The
company
is
also
offering
a
free
trial
of
its
computers
to
consumers

who
qualify
for
its
credit
cards

Keystone
Consolidated
Industries
Inc.
expects
to
report
earnings
before
extraordinary
tax
benefits
of
about
$
1.5
million
,
or
about
41
cents

a
share
,
for
the
third
quarter
,
compared
with
a
loss
last
year
,
said
Glenn
R.
Simmons
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
.

After
a
tax
benefit
of
about
$
780,000
,
Keystone
expects
to
report
net
income
of
$
2.3
million
,
or
about
62
cents

a
share
,
Mr.
Simmons
said
.

For
third
quarter
last
year
,
Keystone
reported
a
$
1
million
loss
from
continuing
operations
and
a
$
200,000
loss
from
discontinued
operations
,
for
a
net
loss
of
$
1.2
million
.

Revenue
for
the
latest
third
quarter
was
about
$
70.5
million
,
up
10
%
from
$
63.6
million
last
year
,
he
said
.

Mr.
Simmons
said
the
results
signal
a
turnaround
for
the
maker
of
wire
and
wire
products
,
which
has
struggled
to
remain
competitive
in
the
face
of
lower-priced
,
imported
steel
.

A
new
$
46
million
steel
rod
minimill
,
which
got
off
to
a
rocky
start
in
early
1988
,
now
is
running
efficiently
and
a
new
management
team
is
more
heavily
marketing
Keystone
's
products
,
Mr.
Simmons
said
.

As
a
result
,
the
company
hopes
to
report
net
income
for
the
year
of
about
$
11.6
million
,
or
about
$
3.10
to
$
3.15

a
share
,
compared
with
a
net
loss
of
$
24.4
million
last
year
,
after
a
loss
from
discontinued
operations
of
$
18.4
million
.

Revenue
for
1989
is
expected
to
be
about
$
300
million
,
up
about
21
%
from
$
247.3
million
in
1988
.

For
the
nine
months
ended
Sept.
30
,
Keystone
expects
to
report
net
income
of
$
9.3
milion
,
or
about
$
2.53

a
share
,
after
an
extraordinary
gain
from
$
3.2
million
in
tax
benefits
.

Last
year
,
the
company
had
a
net
loss
of
$
6.5
million
,
including
a
$
6.1
million
loss
from
continuing
operations
and
a
$
400,000
loss
from
discontinued
operations
.

Revenue
for
the
nine
months
is
expected
to
be
about
$
230.5
million
,
up
about
21
%
from
$
190.4
million
last
year
.

Mr.
Simmons
said
Keystone
's
new
mill
is
expected
to
produce
about
585,000
tons
of
steel
rods

this
year
,
up
from
413,000
tons
in
1988
.

Production
at
the
mill
has
exceeded
the
ability
of
Keystone
's
casting
operation
to
supply
it
,
he
said
,
which
will
force
Keystone
to
purchase
billet
,
or
unfinished
steel
bars
,
from
outside
the
company
during
the
fourth
quarter
and
next
year
.

Keystone
will
have
to
consider
expanding
its
casting
operation
,
at
an
estimated
cost
of
$
8
million
to
$
10
million
,
within
the
next
18
to
24
months
,
Mr.
Simmons
said
.

Under
Robert
W.
Singer
,
who
was
named
president
and
chief
operating
officer
last
year
,
Keystone
has
expanded
its
sales
force
to
about
20
people
from
about
15
and
hopes
to
expand
its
sales
from
the
middle
portion
of
the
country
toward
the
East
and
West
coasts
.

``
Prior
to
a
year
ago
,
Keystone
was
an
order-taker
.

Now
I
think
we
have
a
group
of
marketing
people

who
are
out
selling
to
retailers
and
wholesalers
,
''
Mr.
Simmons
said
.

Still
,
he
said
,
the
100-year-old
company
plans
to
continue
its
premium-priced
strategy
for
its
distinctive
brand
of
red-tipped
wire
fencing
and
other
products
.

The
company
claims
a
40
%
share
of
the
U.S.
field
fence
business
,
a
35
%
share
of
poultry
netting
sales
and
a
30
%
share
of
barbed
wire
sales
.

Axa-Midi
Assurances
of
France
gave
details
of
its
financing
plans
for
its
proposed
$
4.5
billion
acquisition
of
Farmers
Group
Inc.
,
in
amended
filings
with
insurance
regulators
in
the
nine
U.S.
states
where
Farmers
operates
.

The
proposed
acquisition
is
part
of
Sir
James
Goldsmith
's
unfriendly
takeover
attempt
for
B.A.T
Industries
PLC
,
the
British
tobacco
,
retailing
,
paper
and
financial
services
concern

that
is
parent
of
Los
Angeles-based
Farmers
.

In
an
attempt
to
appease
U.S.
regulators
'
concern
over
a
Goldsmith
acquisition
of
Farmers
,
Sir
James
in
August
agreed
to
sell
Farmers
to
Axa
if
he
is
successful
in
acquiring
B.A.T
.

As
part
of
the
agreement
,
Axa
agreed
to
invest
$
1
billion
in
Hoylake
Investments
Ltd.
,
Sir
James
's
acquisition
vehicle
.

Of
the
total
$
5.5
billion
to
be
paid
to
Hoylake
by
Axa
,
about
$
1
billion
will
come
from
available
resources
of
Axa
's
parent
,
Axa-Midi
Group
,
$
2.25
billion
will
be
in
the
form
of
notes
issued
by
Axa
,
and
the
remaining
$
2.25
billion
will
be
in
long-term
bank
loans
.

In
an
interview
Thursday
,
Claude
Bebear
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Axa
,
said
his
group
has
already
obtained
assurances
from
a
group
of
banks
led
by
Cie
.

Financiere
de
Paribas
that
they
can
provide
the
loan
portion
of
the
financing
.

The
other
banking
companies
in
the
group
are
Credit
Lyonnais
,
Societe
Generale
,
BankAmerica
Corp.
and
Citicorp
,
he
said
.

Mr.
Bebear
said
Axa-Midi
Group
has
``
more
than
$
2.5
billion
of
non-strategic
assets
that
we
can
and
will
sell
''
to
help
pay
off
debt
from
the
acquisition
.

He
said
the
assets
to
be
sold
would
be
``
non-insurance
''
assets
,
including
a
beer
company
and
a
real
estate
firm
,
and
would
n't
include
any
pieces
of
Farmers
.

``
We
wo
n't
put
any
burden
on
Farmers
,
''
he
said
.

The
amended
filings
also
point
out
that
under
a
new
agreement
,
Hoylake
has
an
absolute
obligation
to
sell
Farmers
to
Axa
upon
an
acquisition
of
B.A.T
.

``
We
hope
that
with
what

we
did
,
the
regulators
will
not
need
to
evaluate
Hoylake
,
and
they
can
directly
look
at
the
agreement
with
us
,
because
Hoylake
wo
n't
be
an
owner
of
Farmers
at
anytime
,
''
Mr.
Bebear
said
.

Any
change
of
control
in
Farmers
needs
approval
of
the
insurance
commissioners
in
the
nine
states
where
Farmers
and
its
related
companies
are
incorporated
.

The
amended
filings
were
required
because
of
the
new
agreement
between
Axa
and
Hoylake
,
and
to
reflect
the
extension
that
Sir
James
received
last
month
under
British
takeover
rules
to
complete
his
proposed
acquisition
.

Hoylake
dropped
its
initial
#
13.35
billion
(
$
20.71
billion
)
takeover
bid
after
it
received
the
extension
,
but
said
it
would
launch
a
new
bid
if
and
when
the
propsed
sale
of
Farmers
to
Axa
receives
regulatory
approval
.

A
spokesman
for
B.A.T
said
of
the
amended
filings
that
,
``
It
would
appear
that
nothing

substantive
has
changed
.

The
new
financing
structure
is
still
a
very-highly
leveraged
one
,
and
Axa
still
plans
to
take
out
75
%
of
Farmers
'
earnings
as
dividends
to
service
their
debt
.

''
That
dividend
is
almost
double
the
35
%
currently
taken
out
of
Farmers
by
B.A.T
,
the
spokesman
added
.

``
It
would
have
severe
implications
for
Farmers
'
policy
holders
.

''

To
fend
off
Sir
James
's
advances
,
B.A.T
has
proposed
a
sweeping
restructuring
that
would
pare
it
to
a
tobacco
and
financial
services
concern
.

Owens-Corning
Fiberglas
Corp.
said
it
expects
to
report
that
third-quarter
operating
profit
fell
``
substantially
''
from
a
year
earlier
,
when
the
maker
of
insulation
,
roofing
and
plastic
materials
had
profit
before
extraordinary
items
of
$
1.36

a
share
.

In
a
prepared
statement
,
the
company
said
the
decline
``
reflects
reduced
activity
in
construction
,
marine
and
transportation
markets
.

''

An
Owens-Corning
spokesman
said
the
company
still
expects
to
post
net
income
for
the
just-ended
third
quarter
but
he
declined
to
be
more
specific
.

He
also
declined
to
comment
on
expectations
for
the
fourth
quarter
.

Owens-Corning
closed
at
$
30.75

a
share
,
down
$
2.875
,
in
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
following
the
news
.

In
the
1988
third
quarter
,
Owens-Corning
had
profit
from
continuing
operations
of
$
57
million
.

A
charge
of
$
6
million
,
or
15
cents

a
share
,
related
to
the
purchase
of
company
debt
made
net
$
51
million
,
or
$
1.21

a
share
.

Sales
in
the
1988
third
quarter
totaled
$
760
million
.

The
spokesman
said
the
problems
in
the
construction
market
relate
mainly
to
``
reduced
volume
in
insulation
and
roofing
,
especially
reroofing
and
commercial
roofing
products
.

''
He
said
roof
repairs
were
relatively
strong
in
Texas
and
should
be
strong
in
the
Southeast
during
the
fourth
quarter
as
home
and
building
owners
repair
property
damaged
by
Hurricane
Hugo
.

``
But
nationally
,
based
on
trends
so
far
this
year
,
we
expect
{
that
segment
}
to
remain
weak
over
all
,
''
he
said
.

The
spokesman
said
sales
of
reinforced-fiberglass
material
to
the
boat-building
industry
also
were
weak
,
largely
because
of
softening
in
the
marine
market
.

Weakness
in
the
auto
industry
also
is
expected
to
continue
through
the
rest
of
the
year
.

Car
and
truck
production
was
strong
earlier
this
year
,
but
expectations
of
slower
sales
in
the
fourth
quarter
have
cut
manufacturers
'
output
forecasts
.

However
,
Owens-Corning
was
able
to
offset
that
decline
somewhat
with
new
business
at
General
Motors
Corp.
,
which
recently
introduced
a
new
,
plastic-body
van
.

Owens-Corning
expects
to
post
third-quarter
results
by
the
end
of
next
week
,
the
spokesman
said
.

We
do
n't
know
who
is
winning
the
drug
war
in
Latin
America
,
but
we
know
who
's
losing
it
--
the
press
.

Over
the
past
six
months
,
six
journalists
have
been
killed
and
10
kidnapped
by
drug
traffickers
or
leftist
guerrillas
--
who
often
are
one
and
the
same
--
in
Colombia
.

Over
the
past
12
years
,
at
least
40
journalists
have
died
there
.

The
attacks
have
intensified
since
the
Colombian
government
began
cracking
down
on
the
traffickers
in
August
,
trying
to
prevent
their
takeover
of
the
country
.

The
slaughter
in
Colombia
was
very
much
on
the
minds
of
450
editors
and
publishers
from
Latin
America
,
the
United
States
,
the
Caribbean
and
Canada
attending
the
45th
general
assembly
of
the
Inter-American
Press
Association
in
Monterrey
,
Mexico
,
this
week
.

On
Tuesday

the
conference
got
word
of
another
atrocity
,
the
assassination
in
Medellin
of
two
employees
of
El
Espectador
,
Colombia
's
second-largest
newspaper
.

The
paper
's
local
administrator
,
Maria
Luz
Lopez
,
was
shot
dead
,
and
her
mother
wounded
,
while
her
car
was
stopped
for
a
red
light
.

An
hour
later
,
the
paper
's
circulation
manager
,
Miguel
Soler
,
was
shot
and
killed
near
his
home
.

The
drug
lords

who
claimed
responsibility
said
they
would
blow
up
the
Bogota
newspaper
's
offices
if
it
continued
to
distribute
in
Medellin
.

They
bombed
the
Bogota
offices
last
month
,
destroying
its
computer
and
causing
$
2.5
million
in
damage
.

El
Espectador
has
been
a
special
target
because
of
the
extraordinary
courage
of
its
publisher
and
his
staff
.

At
Monterrey
,
publisher
Luis
Gabriel
Cano
,
although
shaken
by
the
murders
,
issued
a
statement
saying
:
``
We
will
not
cease
our
fight
against
drug
trafficking
.

They
want
to
terrify
the
press
and
in
particular
El
Espectador
because
it
has
always
been
a
torchbearer
in
this
war
.

''
This
comes
from
a
man

whose
brother
,
Guillermo
,
was
murdered
in
1986
.

The
publishers
in
Monterrey
command
no
battalions
,
but
they
agreed
to
express
their
outrage
with
editorials
in
today
's
editions
.

Many
will
use
a
common
editorial
.

A
final
statement
yesterday
said
:
``
While
some
advances
are
being
made
in
nations
throughout
the
hemisphere
,
the
state
of
press
freedom
in
the
Americas
still
must
be
regarded
as
grim
as
long
as
journalists
and
their
families
are
subject
to
the
crudest
form
of
censorship
:
death
by
assassination
.

''

The
report
charged
that
Panama
's
Manuel
Noriega
is
not
only
in
league
with
the
drug
traffickers
but
also
is
bullying
the
press
as
never
before
.

``
Noriega
has
closed
every
independent
newspaper
,
radio
and
television
station
and
arrested
,
tortured
or
forced
into
exile

a
long
list
of
reporters
,
''
the
statement
declared
.

It
added
:
``
In
Cuba
,
public
enemy
No.
1
of
press
freedoms
in
the
hemisphere
,
repression
of
journalists

both
Cuban
and
foreign
is
worse
than
ever
.

''
And
in
Nicaragua
,
promises
of
press
freedom
by
the
Sandinistas
``
have
not
materialized
.

''

As
it
happens
,
the
four
countries
cited
,
Colombia
,
Cuba
,
Panama
and
Nicaragua
,
are
not
only
where
the
press
is
under
greatest
attack
but
also
are
linked
by
the
drug
trade
and
left-wing
politics
.

Noriega
is
close
to
Castro
and
may
once
have
been
his
agent
.

Sandinistas
Thomas
Borge
and
the
Ortega
brothers
are
Castro
proteges
;
he
backed
their
takeover
of
Nicaragua
.

In
Colombia
,
the
drug-financed
guerrillas
trying
to
seize
the
country
and
destroy
democracy
include
M-19
,
which

Castro
has
clearly
backed
.

Robert
Merkel
,
a
former
U.S.
attorney
handling
drug
indictments
in
Florida
,
does
n't
think
for
a
minute

that
Castro
's
much
publicized
trials
of
high
officials
engaged
in
the
drug
trade
mean
he
has
broken
off
with
the
Medellin
drug
cartel
.

``
If
the
cartel
succeeds
in
blackmailing
the
Colombian
authorities
into
negotiations
,
the
cartel
will
be
in
control
and
Fidel
can
exploit
his
past
relationships
with
them
,
''
he
told
the
Journal
's
David
Asman
recently
.

The
struggle
against
the
drug
lords
in
Colombia
will
be
a
near
thing
.

This
week
,
the
government
arrested
Jose
Abello
Silva
,
said
to
be
the
fourth-ranking
cartel
leader
.

He
will
probably
be
extradited
to
the
U.S.
for
trial
under
an
extradition
treaty
President
Virgilia
Barco
has
revived
.

Later
,
another
high-ranking
trafficker
,
Leonidas
Vargas
,
was
arrested
and
1,000
pounds
of
dynamite
seized
.

Mr.
Barco
has
refused
U.S.
troops
or
advisers
but
has
accepted
U.S.
military
aid
.

President
Bush
has
agreed
to
meet
within
90
days
with
Mr.
Barco
,
President
Alan
Garcia
of
Peru
and
President
Jaime
Paz
Zamora
of
Bolivia
to
discuss
the
drug
problem
.

It
might
not
be
a
bad
idea
to
do
that
sooner
,
rather
than
later
.

After
the
Panama
fiasco
,
they
will
need
some
reassurance
.

Certainly
,
the
Colombian
press
is
much
in
need
of
that
.

The
carnage
among
takeover
stocks
Friday
does
n't
mean
the
end
of
mega-mergers
but
simply
marks
the
start
of
a
less
ambitious
game
,
Wall
Street
's
big-time
deal
makers
say
.

Suitors
from
now
on
are
more
likely
to
be
expansion-minded
companies
,
rather
than
raiders
or
debt-happy
financiers
.

And
they
will
be
launching
lower-priced
and
perhaps
fewer
deals
,
now
that
it
's
tougher
to
finance
them
.

This
is
an
ominous
sign
for
a
stock
market

that
lately
has
been
fueled
by
takeover
speculation
and
bidding
wars
for
companies

that
put
themselves
up
for
sale
.

Whenever
the
1980s
merger
boom
seems
to
be
stalling
,
shock
waves
ripple
through
the
stock
market
.

``
The
market
is
overvalued
,
not
cheap
,
''
says
Alan
Gaines
of
the
New
York
money-management
firm
Gaines
Berland
.

He
recently
began
increasing
his
cash
position
to
45
%
of
his
portfolio
.

``
I
look
at
where
deals
can
get
done
,
''
he
says
,
``
and
they
're
not
getting
done
''
at
current
prices
.

Lenders
are
growing
increasingly
nervous
about
debt-financed
takeovers
,
investment
bankers
say
.

``
You
had
a
week
of
a
deteriorating
junk-bond
market

that
ran
smack
into
the
news
on
Friday
about
what
appeared
to
be
happening
to
the
bank
debt
market
,
''
says
Steven
Rattner
,
a
partner
and
merger
specialist
with
Lazard
Freres
&
Co
.

Trading
dried
up
Friday
in
the
market
for
high-yield
junk
bonds
,
often
used
to
finance
takeovers
.

It
was
the
latest
in
a
series
of
setbacks
for
the
junk
bond
market
,
where
prices
began
weakening
last
month
after
Campeau
hit
a
cash
crunch
.

And
banks
appear
to
be
taking
an
increasingly
skeptical
view
of
requests
for
high-risk
takeover
loans
.

The
group
trying
to
buy
UAL
announced
Friday
that
it
could
n't
arrange
the
$
7.2
billion
in
bank
loans

it
needs
to
buy
the
parent
of
United
Airlines
for
$
300

a
share
.

Takeover-stock
traders
today
will
be
scrambling
to
learn
of
any
UAL
developments
,
and
other
takeover
stocks
are
likely
to
trade
in
sympathy
.

Investment
bankers
representing
the
buy-out
group
and
UAL
's
board
spent
a
frantic
weekend
trying
to
hammer
out
new
terms

that
would
be
more
acceptable
to
the
banks
.

After
UAL
,
the
stock
viewed
as
most
vulnerable
is
American
Airlines
'
parent
AMR
,
the
target
of
a
$
120-a-share
takeover
proposal
from
New
York
real
estate
developer
Donald
Trump
.

Trading
in
AMR
shares
was
suspended
shortly
after
3
p.m.
EDT
Friday
and
did
n't
resume
.

Before
the
halt
,
AMR
last
traded
at
98
.

Late
Friday
night
,
the
London
office
of
Jefferies
&
Co.
,
a
Los
Angeles
securities
firm
,
traded
AMR
shares
at
prices
as
low
as
80
.

Similarly
,
Delta
Air
Lines
and
USAir
Group
dropped
10.1
%
and
8.5
%
,
respectively
,
on
Friday
and
could
weaken
further
.

Over
the
weeked
,
however
,
two
developments
in
other
deals
indicated
that
commerical
banks
and
Wall
Street
firms
still
are
willing
to
commit
billions
of
dollars
to
finance
takeover
bids
launched
by
major
companies
.

Vitro
S.A.
,
a
major
Mexican
glass
maker
,
said
yesterday
that
it
agreed
to
buy
Anchor
Glass
Container
in
a
tender
offer
for
$
21.25

a
share
,
sweetened
from
the
original
$
20-a-share
offer
Vitro
launched
two
months
ago
.

On
Friday
,
Anchor
shares
fell
1
to
close
at
18
.

For
the
broader
market
,
the
greatest
significance
of
the
Vitro-Anchor
deal
may
be
that
it
was
put
together
late
Friday
night
--
after
the
market
rout
--
and
involves
a
$
155
million
temporary
``
bridge
''
loan
from
Donaldson
,
Lufkin
&
Jenrette
Securities
and
a
$
139
million
loan
from
Security
Pacific
National
Bank
.

Moreover
,
to
complete
the
entire
Anchor
Glass
purchase
and
refinance
existing
debt
,
Donaldson
said
it
is
``
highly
confident
''
that
it
will
be
able
to
sell
$
400
million
of
junk
bonds
for
Vitro
,
despite
the
current
disarray
in
the
junk
bond
market
.

Donaldson
's
statement
is
n't
merely
an
idle
boast
,
because
those
bonds
will
have
to
be
sold
before
Donaldson
's
bridge
loan
can
be
paid
back
.

Security
Pacific
,
meanwhile
,
said
it
expects
to
arrange
$
430
million
in
bank
loans
for
Vitro
.

In
another
takeover
battle
,
a
spokesman
for
McCaw
Cellular
Communications
said
yesterday
that
McCaw
has
been
advised
by
three
commercial
banks
that
they
remain
``
highly
confident
''
they
can
arrange
$
4.5
billion
of
bank
loans
for
McCaw
's
tender
offer
for
about
45
%
of
LIN
Broadcasting
,
``
notwithstanding
recent
events
.

''

McCaw
is
offering
$
125

a
share
for
22
million
LIN
shares
,
thereby
challenging
LIN
's
proposal
to
spin
off
its
television
properties
,
pay
shareholders

a
$
20-a-share
special
dividend
and
combine
its
cellular-telephone
operations
with
BellSouth
's
cellular
business
.

On
Friday
,
LIN
shares
were
among
the
few
takeover
issues

that
did
n't
fall
much
,
dropping
5
,
or
4.9
%
,
to
close
at
107
.

Traders
and
investment
bankers
said
LIN
shares
were
n't
hurt
much
because
BellSouth
is
viewed
as
a
well-financed
corporate
buyer
unlikely
to
be
affected
by
skittishness
among
bankers
or
bond
buyers
.

Investment
bankers
interviewed
over
the
weekend
see
a
silver
lining
for
the
merger
business
in
the
stock-market
drop
.

Potential
bidders
for
companies
``
were
saying
that
things
were
beginning
to
look
expensive
,
''
says
Mr.
Rattner
of
Lazard
.

``
Nothing
makes
things
look
cheaper
than
a
200-point
drop
in
the
Dow
,
''
Mr.
Rattner
says
.

``
Just
as
there
are
people
waiting
to
become
bargain
hunters
in
the
stock
market
,
there
are
people
waiting
to
become
bargain
hunters
in
the
deal
market
.

''

Investment
bankers
expect
most
of
those
bargain
hunters
to
be
well-heeled
corporations
.

``
In
the
past
,
corporate
buyers
were
often
discouraged
from
making
bids
because
of
competition
from
LBO
firms
,
which
were
often
prepared
to
outbid
''
the
corporations
,
says
J.
Tomilson
Hill
,
head
of
mergers
and
acquisitions
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
.

Now
,
``
corporate
buyers
should
be
willing
to
re-enter
the
acquisition
market
because
the
competition
from
junkbond-financed
buyers
has
been
reduced
.

''

Many
takeover
stocks
plunged
Friday
,
as
speculators
retained
their
confidence
in
corporate
buyers
but
fled
from
the
socalled
whisper
stocks
,
the
targets
of
rumored
deals
.

Columbia
Pictures
Entertainment
,
which
has
agreed
to
a
friendly
$
27-a-share
bid
from
Sony
of
Japan
,
fell
only
to
close
at
26
.

But
several
stocks
long
rumored
to
be
ripe
for
a
takeover
or
restructuring
fell
10
%
or
more
.

They
include
USX
,
down
11.7
%
;
Upjohn
,
down
11.1
%
;
Campbell
Soup
,
down
11
%
;
Paramount
Communications
,
off
10.3
%
;
Woolworth
,
down
10.2
%
;
Delta
Air
Lines
,
down
10.1
%
,
and
MCA
,
down
9.7
%
.

The
market
--
and
investment
bankers
--
are
even
less
sanguine
about
companies

that
have
had
at
least
one
bid
,
merger
agreement
or
restructuring
plan
fall
through
already
.

Given
the
weakness
in
both

the
junk
bond
market
and
the
stock
market
,
traders
fear
that
these
transactions
may
be
revised
yet
again
.

Examples
include
Kollmorgen
,
whose
agreement
to
be
acquired
for
$
25

a
share
by
Vernitron
collapsed
last
month
.

Kollmorgen
shares
fell
nearly
20
%
on
Friday
to
close
at
12
.

Ramada
,
which
first
delayed
and
then
shelved
a
$
400
million
junk
bond
sale

that
was
designed
to
help
finance
a
restructuring
,
fell
15.6
%
to
close
at
9
.

Ramada
has
said
it
hopes
to
propose
a
new
restructuring
plan
but
has
n't
indicated
when
it
will
do
so
.

Shares
of
American
Medical
International
,
which
agreed
last
week
to
accept
a
lower
price
from
a
buy-out
group

that
includes
First
Boston
Corp.
and
the
Pritzker
family
of
Chicago
,
fell
15.8
%
on
Friday
to
close
at
20
.

The
buy-out
group
is
offering
$
26.50

a
share
for
63
million
American
Medical
shares
,
down
from
its
offer
in
July
of
$
28

a
share
for
68.8
million
shares
.

But
investment
bankers
say
the
market
may
have
oversold
some
takeover-related
stocks
.

Hilton
Hotels
,
for
example
,
was
among
the
worst-hit
issues
,
falling
20.2
%
to
close
at
85
,
down
21
on
Friday
.

Hilton
currently
is
soliciting
bids
for
a
sale
of
part
or
all
of
its
hotel
and
casino
businesses
.

People
familiar
with
Hilton
said
over
the
weekend
that
the
depth
of
the
sell-off
in
Hilton
shares
was
unwarranted
because
none
of
the
likely
buyers
would
be
dependent
on
junk-bond
financing
.

However
,
they
conceded
that
some
potential
bidders
would
rely
on
bank
loans
and
would
be
hurt
if
the
troubles
of
the
UAL
buy-out
group
signified
a
general
unwillingness
among
banks
to
provide
credit
for
debt-financed
takeovers
.

Hilton
officials
said
they
were
n't
worried
about
the
drop
in
the
company
's
stock
.

William
Lebo
,
Hilton
's
general
counsel
,
said
plans
to
consider
a
sale
of
the
company
or
some
of
its
assets
are
``
on
track
''
for
what
has
been
described
previously
as
``
a
slow
and
deliberate
process
.

''

``
I
ca
n't
believe
that
any
potential
buyer
for
Hilton
would
be
affected
by
one
day
's
trading
,
''
Mr.
Lebo
said
.

But
the
stock
market
as
a
whole
,
bolstered
as
it
is
by
takeover
speculation
,
remains
vulnerable
to
any
further
pullback
by
takeover
financiers
,
both
in
the
junkbond
market
and
among
commercial
banks
.

For
debt-ridden
suitors
,
``
the
takeover
game
has
been
over
for
some
time
,
''
says
New
York
money
manager
Neil
Weisman
of
Chilmark
Capital
,
who
has
been
keeping
85
%
of
his
portfolio
in
cash
.

``
The
market
is
just
waking
up
to
that
point
.

Cummins
Engine
Co.
shares
dropped
yesterday
after
the
company
disclosed
it
will
have
to
correct
defects
in
pistons
installed
in
some
of
its
engines
.

In
a
terse
release
,
the
maker
of
diesel
engines
,
parts
and
power
systems
said
it
has
``
identified
a
problem
''
with
pistons
used
in
its
model
K
and
KV
diesels
since
May
1
.

The
high-horsepower
motors
are
used
in
heavy
applications
such
as
construction
and
mining
equipment
.

Cummins
said
the
problem
relates
to
recent
modifications
in
the
design
of
a
piston

it
buys
from
an
outside
supplier
.

None
of
the
engines
have
failed
to
date
,
said
a
spokeswoman
,
adding
that
the
defect
does
n't
represent
a
hazard
.

The
company
would
n't
identify
the
supplier
,
nor
would
it
say
how
many
of
the
defective
engines

it
has
produced
.

A
spokeswoman
noted
,
however
,
that
such
engines
represented
only
2.5
%
of
the
company
's
overall
production
in
the
first
six
months
of
the
year
.

The
company
said
it
will
replace
all
pistons
in
the
affected
engines
,
and
as
a
result
,
will
``
supplement
K
and
KV
warranty
accruals
.

''
The
spokeswoman
declined
to
say
how
much
money

the
company
will
have
to
spend
on
the
repairs
;
the
company
recently
halted
production
of
the
models
until
replacement
pistons
are
available
Oct.
16
.

In
composite
New
York
Stock
Exchange
trading
yesterday
,
Cummins
shares
stumbled
$
2
to
close
at
$
52
.

The
company
's
shares
traded
as
high
as
$
64
last
month
,
before
Cummins
disclosed
in
late
September
that
it
expects
to
report
a
``
substantial
''
third-quarter
loss
because
of
deteriorating
demand
and
other
difficulties
.

Avions
Marcel
Dassault-Breguet
Aviation
S.A.
said
group
profit
before
taxes
and
contributions
to
employee
profit-sharing
soared
97
%
to
839
million
francs
(
$
129.6
million
)
in
the
first

half
of
1989
from
425
million
francs

a
year
earlier
.

The
French
aircraft
group
pointed
out
,
however
,
that
financial
results
from
its
sector
of
industry
are
frequently
erratic
because
of
irregular
cash
flow
from
large
contracts
.

It
noted
,
for
example
,
that
group
revenue
for
the
first

half
was
8.734
billion
francs
,
down
about
12
%
from
9.934
billion
francs

a
year
earlier
.

Still
,
it
said
it
expects
sales
for
all
of
1989
to
be
on
the
order
of
20
billion
francs
,
reflecting
anticipated
billings
for
two
large
contracts
in
the
second

half
of
the
year
.

For
all
of
1988
,
Dassault
had
group
profit
of
428
million
francs
on
revenue
of
18.819
billion
francs
.

The
group
has
n't
yet
released
earnings
figures
for
the
first

half
of
1989
,
nor
has
it
made
a
detailed
forecast
of
its
full-year
earnings
.

Hammond
Co.
,
Newport
Beach
,
Calif.
,
said
Fidelity
National
Financial
Inc.
extended
its
previous
agreement
,
under
which

it
wo
n't
purchase
any
more
of
the
mortgage
banker
's
common
stock
,
through
Oct.
31
.

The
previous
agreement
expired
Thursday
.

Hammond
said
that
its
discussions
with
Fidelity
,
an
Irvine
,
Calif.
,
title-insurance
underwriter
,
are
continuing
,
but
that
prospects
for
a
longer-term
standstill
agreement
are
uncertain
.

Fidelity
has
increased
its
stake
in
Hammond
to
23.57
%
in
recent
months
.

Statements
made
in
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
filings
led
Hammond
to
request
a
standstill
agreement
.

A
federal
appeals
court
in
San
Francisco
ruled
that
shareholders
ca
n't
hold
corporate
officials
liable
for
false
sales
projections
on
new
products
if
the
news
media
concurrently
revealed
substantial
information
about
the
product
's
flaws
.

The
ruling
stems
from
a
1984
suit
filed
by
shareholders
of
Apple
Computer
Inc.
,
claiming
that
company
officials
misled
investors
about
the
expected
success
of
the
Lisa
computer
,
introduced
in
1983
.

Lawyers
specializing
in
shareholder
suits
said
they
are
concerned
that
use
of
the
``
press
defense
''
by
corporations
may
become
popular
as
a
result
of
the
ruling
.

According
to
the
suit
,
Apple
officials
created
public
excitement
by
touting
Lisa
as
an
office
computer

that
would
revolutionize
the
workplace
and
be
extremely
successful
in
its
first
year
.

The
plaintiffs
also
alleged
that
prior
to
the
fanfare
,
the
company
circulated
internal
memos
indicating
problems
with
Lisa
.

The
suit
claimed
Apple
's
stock
climbed
to
a
high
of
$
63.50

a
share
on
the
basis
of
the
company
's
optimistic
forecasts
.

But
when
the
company
revealed
Lisa
's
poor
sales
late
in
1983
,
the
stock
plummeted
to
a
low
of
$
17.37

a
share
,
according
to
the
suit
.

The
shareholders
claimed
more
than
$
150
million
in
losses
.

In
1987
,
the
San
Francisco
district
court
dismissed
the
case
largely
because
newspaper
reports
had
sufficiently
counterbalanced
the
company
's
statements
by
alerting
consumers
to
Lisa
's
problems
.

Late
last
month
,
the
appeals
court
agreed
that
most
of
the
case
should
be
dismissed
.

However
,
it
gave
the
shareholders

the
right
to
pursue
a
small
portion
of
their
claim

that
pertains
to
Lisa
's
disk
drive
,
known
as
Twiggy
.

The
court
ruled
that
the
news
media
did
n't
reveal
Twiggy
's
problems
at
the
time
.

Lawyers
are
worried
about
the
ruling
's

pointed
out
that
the
court
stressed
that
the
ruling
should
be
regarded
as
very
specific
to
the
Apple

.

``
The
court
was
careful
to
say
that

appeared
in

received
the

a
Los
Angeles
lawyer
at
the

Chimicles
,
which
was

involved
in

``
The
court
is
saying
that
the
adverse

to
be
transferred
to

NFL
ORDERED
to
pay
$
5.5
million
in
legal
fees
to
defunct

The
National
Football
League
is
considering
appealing
the
ruling
stemming
from
the
U.S.
Football
League
's
largely
unsuccessful
antitrust
suit
against
the
NFL
.

A
jury
in
1986
agreed
with
the
USFL
's
claims
that
the
NFL
monopolized
major
league
football
.

But
the
jury
awarded
the
USFL
only
$
1
in
damages
,
trebled
because
of
the
antitrust
claims
.

Last
week
,
the
U.S.
Court
of
Appeals
in
New
York
upheld
a
$
5.5
million
award
of
attorneys
fees
to
the
defunct
league
.

Harvey
D.
Myerson
,
of
Myerson
&
Kuhn
,
then
of
Finley
,
Kumble
,
Wagner
,
Heine
,
Underberg
,
Manley
,
Myerson
&
Casey
,
was
the
lead
trial
lawyer
,
and
his
new
firm
pursued
the
application
appeal
.

Douglas
R.
Pappas
of
Myerson
&
Kuhn
says
about
$
5.3
million
of
the
award
goes
directly
to
the
USFL
to
reimburse
it
for
fees
already
paid
.

Myerson
&
Kuhn
will
get
about
$
260,000
for
the
costs
of
pressing
the
application
.

The
federal
appeals
court
held
that
the
nominal
damages
and
the
failure
to
prove
all
claims
did
n't
exclude
the
USFL
from
being
reimbursed
.

Antitrust
laws
provide
that
injured
parties
may
be
reimbursed
for
lawyers
'
fees
.

But
Shepard
Goldfein
,
an
attorney
for
the
NFL
,
says
his
client
will
consider
asking
for
another
hearing
or
appealing
to
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
.

Mr.
Goldfein
,
of
Skadden
,
Arps
,
Slate
,
Meagher
&
Flom
in
New
York
,
says
the
ruling
is
wrong
and
the
fee
award
is
excessive
because
the
USFL
lost
its
major
claims
,
including
its
contention
that
the
NFL
restrained
trade
through
television
contracts
.

``
The
USFL
was
not
the
prevailing
party
,
''
Mr.
Goldfein
insists
.

HOUSTON-CALGARY
ALLIANCE
:
Fulbright
&
Jaworski
of
Houston
and
Fenerty
,
Robertson
,
Fraser
&
Hatch
of
Calgary
,
Alberta
,
are
affiliating
to
help
serve
their
energy-industry
clients
.

The
affiliation
is
believed
to
be
the
first
such
cross-border
arrangement
among
major
law
firms
.

The
firms
are
n't
required
to
refer
work
exclusively
to
each
other
and
remain
separate
organizations
.

But
they
will
work
together
on
energy
-
,
environmental
-
and
fair-trade-related
issues
and
conduct
seminars
on
topics
of
mutual
interest
,
said
Gibson
Gayle
Jr.
of
585-lawyer
Fulbright
&
Jaworski
.

In
addition
,
Fulbright
&
Jaworski
's
Washington
,
D.C.
,
office
will
play
a
key
role
as
the
firms
work
together
on
regulatory
issues
,
particularly
natural-gas
exports
,
for
their
clients
.

The
arrangement
,
reached
after
about
eight
months
of
negotiations
,
grew
out
of
80-lawyer
Fenerty
Robertson
's
desire
to
develop
ties
with
a
U.S.
firm
in
light
of
relaxed
trade
barriers
between
the
U.S.
and
Canada
,
said
Francis
M.
Saville
of
Fenerty
Robertson
.

IN
WHAT

MAY
SIGNAL

a
turnaround
for
asbestos
manufacturers
,
W.R.
Grace
&
Co.
won
a
3
trial
in
Pittsburgh
over
whether
it
should
be
required
to
remove
asbestos
fireproofing
from
a
local
high
school
.

Mount
Lebanon
High
School
,
near
Pittsburgh
,
sought
$
21
million
in
compensatory
damages
from
Grace
,
arguing
that
the
asbestos
,
which
can
cause
respiratory
diseases
and
lung
cancer
,
posed
a
risk
to
students
.

Grace
successfully
contended
that
removing
the
fire
retardant
would
pose
a
greater
health
risk
than
leaving
it
alone
.

A
spokesman
for
the
company
said
the
verdict
is
thought
to
be
the
first
in
favor
of
an
asbestos
manufacturer
where
the
plaintiff
was
a
school
and
the
asbestos
in
question
was
used
for
fireproofing
.

early
this

after
nearly
three

.

She
was
the
first
woman
to
be

FCC
general

.

RICHARD

top

,
joined

firm
of

Lord

Barrett

as
a

.

Mr.

,
45
,
spent
17
years
at
the
Miami
airline
unit
of
Houston-based
Texas
Air
Corp.
and
was
named
general
counsel
in
1984
.

He
left
the
company
in
1987
.

Mr.

said
he
will
split
his
time
between
the
200-lawyer
firm
's
offices
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
and
New

,
with
specialties
in
aviation
and
labor
law
.

Microamerica
Inc.
said
its
board
authorized
the
purchase
of
as
many
as
two
million
,
or
15
%
,
of
its
common
shares
outstanding
.

The
purchases
would
be
made
periodically
on
the
open
market
or
in
privately
negotiated
transactions
,
the
company
said
.

Microamerica
,
a
distributor
of
personal-computer
products
,
has
about
13.5
million
shares
outstanding
.

Demand
for
products
in
the
current
quarter
should
weaken
and
inflation
should
n't
put
any
upward
pressure
on
prices
,
say
U.S.
plant
managers
in
a
Dun
&
Bradstreet
Corp.
survey
.

Fewer
plant
managers
expect
higher
new
orders
and
output

this
quarter
than
in
the
year-earlier
period
,
according
to
the
survey
,
which
polls
1,500
managers
of
manufacturing
facilities
on
conditions
in
their
factories
and
industries
.

Plant
managers
'
optimism
``
has
moderated
,
which
is
in
line
with
current
economic
data

that
indicate
slow
but
continuing
economic
growth
,
''
said
Joseph
W.
Duncan
,
corporate
economist
and
chief
statistician
for
Dun
&
Bradstreet
,
a
financial-data
company
.

The
managers
expect
materials
costs
to
drop
in
the
quarter
,
leading
fewer
to
forecast
higher
selling
prices
,
Mr.
Duncan
said
.

Dun
&
Bradstreet
calculates
several
optimism
indexes
,
subtracting
the
percentage
of
managers
expecting
a
decline
from
the
percentage
expecting
growth
.

For
overall
demand
,
the
fourth-quarter
index
fell
to
28
from
31
last
quarter
and
32
in
the
1988
fourth
period
.

For
output
,
the
index
was
29
,
the
same
as
last
quarter
,
but
a
three-point
drop
from
a
year
ago
.

For
new
orders
,
the
figure
again
was
flat
with
the
third
quarter
at
29
.

The
latest
figure
also
is
down
a
point
from
the
year
earlier
.

The
U.S.
dollar
strengthened
during
the
summer
and
may
have
damped

the
managers
'
hopes
for
higher
demand
from
overseas
.

Recent
``
declines
in
the
dollar
should
bolster
manufacturers
'
selling
opportunities
abroad
,
''
Mr.
Duncan
said
.

For
the
next
12
months
,
each
of
the
indexes
for
overall
demand
,
production
and
new
orders
fell
one
point
from
last
quarter
,
to
57
,
57
and
59
,
respectively
.

The
year-earlier
figures
were
60
,
60
and
61
.

Dun
&
Bradstreet
's
data
measuring
fourth-quarter
costs
of
making
a
single
unit
of
a
product
indicated
that
``
manufacturers
foresee
weaker
prices
''
for
materials
``
while
wage
pressures
,
though
still
present
,
are
not
expected
to
escalate
,
''
Mr.
Duncan
said
.

Tokyo
stocks
fell
sharply
as
the
dollar
remained
strong
despite
Wednesday
's
half-point
discount
rate
increase
by
the
Bank
of
Japan
.

London
shares
recovered
some
lost
ground
,
largely
on
technical
factors
as
Chancellor
Nigel
Lawson
's
speech
to
the
Conservative
Party
conference
was
viewed
as
basically
neutral
for
the
market
.

Tokyo
's
Nikkei
Index
of
225
issues
,
which
fell
136.28
points
Wednesday
,
closed
at
34795.05
,
down
445.02
.

The
decline
of
nearly
1.3
%
left
the
index
below
35000
for
the
first
time
since
Sept.
25
.

In
the
first
hour
of
trading
in
Tokyo
Friday
,
the
Nikkei
Index
rose
145.96
points
to
34941.01
.

Thursday
's
volume
on
the
first
section
was
estimated
at
650
million
shares
,
compared
with
751
million
Wednesday
.

Declining
issues
outpaced
advancers
857-161
,
with
110
unchanged
.

The
Tokyo
Stock
Price
Index
of
all
issues
in
the
first
section
,
which
lost
13.07
Wednesday
,
was
down
36.89
,
or
1.4
%
,
to
2623.60
.

The
market
opened
at
what
proved
to
be
its
high
and
continued
to
slip
toward
the
end
of
the
day
.

Traders
said
the
reason
its
drop
was
larger
than
Wednesday
's
moderate
loss
was
that
investors
began
selling
their
holdings
when
they
saw
that
Wednesday
's
rise
to
3.75
%
in
the
discount
rate
--
the
central
bank
's
base
rate
on
loans
to
commercial
banks
--
failed
to
curb
the
dollar
's
rise
against
the
yen
.

A
stronger
dollar
concerns
Japanese
stock
investors
because
it
contributes
to
Japanese
inflation
,
particularly
by
raising
oil
and
other
energy
and
natural
resource
prices
,
which
are
denominated
in
dollars
.

In
addition
,
higher
prices
for
imports
allow
domestic
manufacturers
to
increase
their
own
prices
.

Moreover
,
the
current
high
level
of
the
U.S.
stock
market
,
and
the
possibility
of
U.S.
interest
rates
being
cut
or
Japanese
rates
being
raised
again
to
keep
the
dollar
down
,
might
draw
funds
currently
invested
in
Japanese
equities
into
the
U.S.
market
,
some
investors
fear
.

Masami
Okuma
,
senior
trader
at
UBS
Phillips
&
Drew
International
,
said
expectations
of
another
increase
in
the
discount
rate
already
are
causing
some
investors
not
only
to
stop
buying
but
also
to
dump
some
of
their
recently
acquired
shares
.

Yoshiaki
Mitsuoka
,
manager
of
the
investment
information
department
at
Daiwa
Investment
Trust
&
Management
Co.
,
said
the
market
had
been
sustained
recently
by
smaller
issues
with
relatively
low
price-earnings
ratios
.

Prices
of
such
shares
,
he
said
,
now
have
risen
an
average
of
57
%
in
the
past
six
months
,
making
them
less
attractive
for
fresh
buying
.

Yukio
Itagaki
,
director
of
the
fund
management
department
at
Kokusai
Investment
Trust
Management
Co.
,
said
the
discount
rate
increase
did
n't
have
much
effect
on
the
actual
market
environment
,
as
short-term
interest
rates
already
had
been
above
5
%
.

And
as
the
rate
on
newly
issued
three-month
certificates
of
deposit
went
up
to
6.2
%
Wednesday
,
institutions
and
corporations
had
little
incentive
to
invest
new
funds
in
stocks
.

The
higher
discount
rate
discouraged
institutions
from
holding
steel
and
construction
shares
,
traders
said
.

Nippon
Steel
fell
10
to
698
yen
(
$
4.83
)
a
share
,
Sumitomo
Metal
lost
19
to
677
,
and
Kobe
Steel
was
down
9
at
690
.

Kajima
was
down
100
at
1,900
,
while
Ohbayashi
lost
60
to
1,500
.

Shipbuilding
issues
also
were
sold
off
.

Kawasaki
Heavy
Industries
fell
37
to
903
,
and
Mitsubishi
Heavy
Industries
was
down
30
at
1,010
.

Among
housing
issues
,
Misawa
Homes
lost
140
to
2,830
,
Sekisui
House
declined
70
to
2,400
,
and
Daiwa
House
lost
100
to
2,470
.

Retail
issues
,
which
advanced
in
September
on
speculation
about
mergers
and
acquisitions
in
the
sector
,
were
sold
on
profit-taking
,
traders
said
.

Seiyu
was
down
240
at
2,710
,
Daiei
fell
70
to
2,980
,
and
Isetan
lost
170
to
4,720
.

Some
of
the
blue-chip
issues

that
had
gained
in
the
previous
couple
of
days
were
lower
as
investors
retreated
quickly
.

Hitachi
lost
10
to
1,510
,
Toshiba
was
down
40
at
1,130
,
and
Toyota
Motor
lost
30
to
2,820
.

Among
the
few
winners
was
Sharp
,
which
attracted
investors
because
of
growing
demand
for
its
liquid
crystal
projectors
,
traders
said
.

Sharp
gained
20
to
1,550
.

Other
gainers
included
Nippon
Shokubai
,
which
rose
70
to
2,270
,
Nikon
,
up
30
to
1,620
,
and
Aiwa
,
which
gained
120
to
2,000
.

In
London
,
the
Financial
Times-Stock
Exchange
100-share
index
finished
19
points

The
Financial
Times
30-share

rose
20.4
to

Chancellor
Lawson
,
who
has
been
under
political
fire
for
his
decision

a
week
ago
to
force
U.K.
banks
'
base
lending
rates
up
to
15
%
,
an
eight-year
high
,
addressed
the
governing
Conservatives
'
annual
conference
on
current
economic
issues
,
and
dealers
said
the
speech
was
exactly
what

the
market
had
expected
.

``
It
was
a
good
party
political
conference
speech
,
''
a
dealer
with
a
large
U.K.
market-making
operation
said
.

``
He
did
n't
calm
any
fears
or
anxieties
,
but
at
least

he
did
n't
create
any
new
ones
.

''

Dealers
attributed
the
day
's
advances
largely
to
a
technical
rebound
from
the
sharp
declines

that
followed
last
week
's
base-rate
increase
.

They
also
cited
markdowns
by
market-makers
seeking
to
generate
some
business
and
a
general
absence
of
active
selling
.

There
was
also
some
speculative
energy

that
helped
to
support
the
FT-SE
100
later
in
the
session
,
when
Wall
Street
showed
signs
of
weakness
early
in
its
trading
day
.

That
energy
came
in
part
from
renewed
rumors
that
U.S.
takeover
specialists
Kohlberg
Kravis
Roberts
are
preparing
to
make
a
takeover
bid
for
industrial
concern
BTR
rather
than
simply
take
a
15
%
stake
in
it
.

Dealers
also
pointed
to
active
options
dealing
in
the
stock
recently
and
said
some
of
the
options
had
been
exercised
.

BTR
ended
7
higher
at
437
pence
(
$
6.76
)
a
share
.

Ferranti
International
Signal
rose
1
to
58
on
8.5
million

.

British
Aerospace
said
earlier
in
the
week
that
it
was
considering
making
a
joint
bid
with
France
's
Thomson-CSF
for
Ferranti
.

ASDA

as

To
make
them
directly
comparable
,
each

is
based
on
the
close

equaling
100
.

The
percentage
change
is
since
year-end
.

The
nation
's
biggest
beverage
companies
are
expected
to
report
stronger
third-quarter
earnings
,
even
as
the
soft-drink
giants
take
their
lumps
from
higher
domestic
soda
prices
and
brewers
'
struggle
with
flat
industry
volume
.

Coca-Cola
Co.
,
the
first
of
the
group
to
report
,
said
yesterday
that
earnings
rose
10
%
,
excluding
a
gain
from
the
sale
of
a
bottled
water
business
.

PepsiCo
Inc.
and
Anheuser-Busch
Cos.
will
report
third-quarter
earnings
gains
of
at
least
9
%
and
14
%
,
respectively
,
while
results
for
Coca-Cola
Enterprises
Inc.
and
Adolph
Coors
Co.
will
decline
,
analysts
estimate
.

Since
the
summer
,
soft-drink
companies
have
been
trying
to
extract
themselves
from
a
price-slashing
war
designed
to
steal
market
share
from
each
other
.

The
battle
drove
up
volumes
for
several
years
,
but
the
discounted
prices
have
squeezed
bottlers
'
profit
margins
.

Because
raw
material
costs
have
been
escalating
and
because
Coke
and
Pepsi
have
become
bigger
owners
of
bottling
businesses
,
the
companies
have
been
raising
soda
pop
prices
in
recent
months
.

That
,
along
with
generally
cooler
,
rainier
weather

this
year
,
has
slowed
the
industry
's
volume
growth
.

Unlike
the
4
%
to
5
%
growth
rate
of
recent
years
,
the
soft-drink
industry
is
expected
to
report
third-quarter
volume
was
,
at
worst
,
flat
,
and
at
best
,
up
only
3
%
.

That
's
a
fairly
wide
range
,
given
the
sheer
size
of
the
$
42
billion
soft-drink
industry
.

But
analysts
,
and
indeed
,
some
of
the
soda
companies
,
have
had
difficulty
predicting
consumer
reaction
to
higher
prices
.

In
August
,
Coca-Cola
Enterprises
,
Coke
's
largest
bottling
operation
,
said
its
1989
earnings
would
fall
as
much
as
37
%
,
partly
because
it
misjudged
consumer
resistance
to
the
new
prices
,
which
were
2
%
to
3
%
higher
on
average
in
July
and
August
.

Blaming
higher
prices
in
part
,
Coca-Cola
said
its
third-quarter
unit
case
sales
were
flat
.

The
volume
in
the
summer
selling
season
suffered
,
too
,
from
the
lack
of
a
critical
,
yet
intangible
,
element
in
the
softdrink
industry
:
excitement
.

After
a
controversial
flap
involving
a
Madonna
music
video
,
Pepsi
dropped
its
plans
for
a
big
summer
advertising
promotion
featuring
the
pop
singer
.

And
there
have
been
no
major
new
product
introductions
,
such
as
cherry-flavored
soft
drinks
,
which
made
sales
sizzle
two
years
ago
.

``
What
's
been
hot
in
the
soft-drink
business
lately
?
''
asks
Emanuel
Goldman
,
an
analyst
with
PaineWebber
Inc
.

``
Nothing
.

''

Still
,
the
beverage
industry
's
slower
results
in
the
latest
quarter
could
lead
to
some
positive
earnings
surprises
in
next
year
's
third
quarter
,
when
comparisons
will
be
easier
,
said
George
Thompson
,
an
analyst
with
Prudential-Bache
Securities
Inc
.

``
This
year
's
ugly
ducklings
will
be
next
year
's
swans
,
''
he
said
.

Coca-Cola
's
earnings
were
stronger
primarily
because
of
sharply
improved
volume
from
the
company
's
international
operations
,
which
account
for
the
bulk
of
its
business
.

Volume
rose
14
%
,
well
ahead
of
analysts
'
10
%
to
11
%
projections
for
the
business
.

Analysts
are
looking
for
Pepsi
to
earn
as
much
as
$
1.04

a
share
,
with
most
estimates
settling
around
99
cents
,
compared
with
91
cents
in
the
year-ago
quarter
.

The
latest
quarter
results
,
are
expected
to
be
a
little
soft
compared
with
Pepsi
's
historical
earnings
growth
rate
,
reflecting
some
dilution
for
snack-food
and
soft-drink
bottling
acquisitions
.

Stronger
restaurant
and
snack-food
sales
helped
boost
Pepsi
's
profits
,
too
,
analysts
said
.

Anheuser-Busch
is
expected
to
report
third-quarter
earnings
between
89
cents
and
92
cents

a
share
,
compared
with
78
cents

a
year
earlier
.

On
the
strength
of
Bud
Light
,
Busch
and
Michelob
Dry
,
the
company
's
volume
in
the
quarter
is
estimated
to
increase
about
3
%
to
4
%
,
while
the
rest
of
the
industry
will
be
flat
,
or
up
slightly
.

Coors
earnings
are
expected
to
fall
,
as
its
volume
declines
perhaps
3
%
to
4
%
.

Coors
is
expected
to
achieve
greater
production
efficiencies
once
it
completes
its
plan
,
announced
last
month
,
to
acquire
most
of
the
beer-related
assets
of
Stroh
Brewery
Co
.

The
market
for
$
200
billion
of
high-risk
junk
bonds
,
battered
by
a
succession
of
defaults
and
huge
price
declines
this
year
,
practically
vanished
Friday
.

Trading
ground
to
a
halt
as
investors
rushed
to
sell
bonds
,
only
to
find
themselves
deserted
by
potential
buyers
.

Stunned
,
they
watched
brokerage
houses
mark
down
price
quotations
on
their
junk
holdings
while
being
able
to
execute
very
few
actual
trades
.

``
The
junk
bond
market
is
in
a
state
of
gridlock
now
--
there
are
no
bids
,
only
offers
,
''
says
independent
investor
Martin
D.
Sass
,
who
manages
nearly
$
4
billion
and
who
recently
decided
to
buy
distressed
securities
for
a
new
fund
.

This
calamity
is
``
far
from
over
,
''
he
says
.

Junk
's
collapse
helped
stoke
the
panicky
selling
of
stocks

that
produced
the
deepest
one-day
dive
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
since
the
Oct.
19
,
1987
,
crash
.

Simultaneously
,
it
also
helped
trigger

this
year
's
biggest
rally
in
the
U.S.
government
bond
market
as
investors
rushed
to
move
capital
into
the
highest-quality
securities
they
could
find
.

But
``
an
eerie
silence
pervaded
''
the
junk
market
Friday
as
prices
tumbled
on
hundreds
of
high-yield
bonds
despite
``
no
active
trading
,
''
says
John
Lonski
,
an
economist
at
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc
.

For
example
,
the
price
of
Southland
Corp.
's
$
500
million
of
16
%
bonds
due
2002
--
sold
less
than
two
years
ago
by
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
--
plummeted
25
%
to
just
30
cents
on
the
dollar
.

But
not
even
Goldman
would
make
a
market
in
the
securities
of
Southland
,
the
owner
of
the
nationwide
chain
of
7-11
convenience
stores

that
is
strapped
for
cash
.

Goldman
officials
declined
to
comment
.

Junk
bonds
,
which
mushroomed
from
less
than
$
2
billion
at
the
start
of
this
decade
,
have
been
declining
for
months
as
issuer
after
issuer
sank
beneath
the
weight
of
hefty
interest
payments
.

The
shaky
market
received
its
biggest
jolt
last
month
from
Campeau
Corp.
,
which
created
its
U.S.
retailing
empire
with
junk
financing
.

Campeau
developed
a
cash
squeeze

that
caused
it
to
be
tardy
on
some
interest
payments
and
to
put
its
prestigious
Bloomingdales
department-store
chain
up
for
sale
.

Now
,
dozens
of
corporations
,
including
Ethan
Allen
,
TW
Services
and
York
International
,
that
are
counting
on
at
least
$
7
billion
of
scheduled
new
junk
financings
to
keep
their
highly
leveraged
takeovers
and
buy-outs
afloat
,
may
never
get
the
money
.

``
The
music
has
stopped
playing
,
''
says
Michael
Harkins
,
a
principal
in
the
investment
firm
of
Levy
Harkins
.

``
You
've
either
got
a
chair
or
you
do
n't
.

''

In
Friday
's
aftermath
,
says
R.
Douglas
Carleton
,
a
director
of
high-yield
finance
at
First
Boston
Corp.
,
``
much
of
the
$
7
billion
forward
calendar
could
be
deferred
,
depending
on
the
hysteria
.

''
In
August
,
First
Boston
withdrew
a
$
475
million
junk
offering
of
Ohio
Mattress
bonds
because
potential
buyers
were
``
very
skittish
.

''

The
outlook
``
looks
shaky
because
we
're
still
waiting
''
for
mutual
funds
,
in
particular
,
to
dump
some
of
their
junk
bond
holdings
to
pay
off
redemptions
by
individual
investors
,
says
King
Penniman
,
senior
vice
president
at
McCarthy
,
Crisanti
&
Maffei
,
an
investment
arm
of
Xerox
Financial
Services
.

Indeed
,
a
Moody
's
index

that
tracks
the
net
asset
values
of
24
high-yield
mutual
funds
declined
for
the
17th
consecutive
day
Friday
.

In
a
stark
contrast
,
the
benchmark
30-year
Treasury
bond
climbed
more
than
2
points
,
or
about
$
25
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
,
to
103
,
its
biggest
gain
of
the
year
.

The
bond
's
yield
dropped
to
7.82
%
,
the
lowest
since
March
31
,
1987
,
according
to
Technical
Data
Global
Markets
Group
.

The
yield
on
three-month
Treasury
bills
,
considered
the
safest
of
all
investments
,
plummeted
about
0.7
percentage
point
to
7.16
%
,
the
largest
one-day
decline
since
1982
.

The
main
catalyst
for
government
bond
market
rally
was
the
190.58-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

``
When
you
get
panic
in
one
market
,
you
get
flight
to
quality
in
the
other
,
''
said
Maria
Ramirez
,
money
market
economist
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc
.

Nevertheless
,
the
problems
of
the
junk
market
could
prompt
the
Federal
Reserve
to
ease
credit
in
the
months
ahead
.

``
This
marks
a
significant
shift
in
the
interest
rate
outlook
,
''
says
William
Sullivan
,
director
of
money
market
research
at
Dean
Witter
Reynolds
Inc.
,
New
York
.

Any
sustained
credit-easing
could
be
a
lift
for
junk
bonds
as
well
as
other
securities
.

Robert
Dow
,
a
partner
and
portfolio
manager
at
Lord
,
Abbett
&
Co.
,
which
manages
$
4
billion
of
high-yield
bonds
,
says
he
does
n't
``
think
there
is
any
fundamental
economic
rationale
{
for
the
junk
bond
rout
}
.

It
was
herd
instinct
.

''

He
adds
:
``
The
junk
market
has
witnessed
some
trouble
and
now
some
people
think
that
if
the
equity
market
gets
creamed
that
means
the
economy
will
be
terrible
and
that
's
bad
for
junk
.

I
do
n't
believe
that
's
the
case
,
but
I
believe
that
people
are
running
scared
.

There
is
a
flight
to
quality
,
and
the
quality
is
not
in
equities
and
not
in
junk
--
it
's
in
Treasurys
.

''

Even
as
trading
in
high-yield
issues
dried
up
over
the
past
month
,
corporations
sold
more
than
$
2
billion
of
new
junk
bonds
.

For
example
,
a
recent
$
375
million
offering
of
Petrolane
Gas
Services
L.P.
bonds
sold
by
First
Boston
was
three
times
oversubscribed
.

A
$
550
million
offering
of
Turner
Broadcasting
System
Inc
.

high-yield
securities
sold
last
week
by
Drexel
was
increased
$
50
million
because
of
strong
demand
.

First
Boston
estimates
that
in
November
and
December
alone
,
junk
bond
investors
will
receive
$
4.8
billion
of
coupon
interest
payments
.

``
That
's
a
clear
indication
that
there
is
and
will
be
an
undercurrent
of
basic
business
going
on
,
''
says
Mr.
Carleton
of
First
Boston
.

``
I
do
n't
know
how
people
can
say
the
junk
bond
market
disappeared
when
there
were
$
1.5
billion
of
orders
for
$
550
million
of
junk
bonds
sold
last
week
by
Turner
,
''
says
Raymond
Minella
,
co-head
of
merchant
banking
at
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co
.

``
When
the
rally
comes
,
insurance
companies
will
be
leading
it
because
they
have
billions
to
invest
and
invest
they
will
.

There
is
plenty
of
money
available
from
people

who
want
to
buy
well-structured
deals
;
it
's
the
stuff

that
's
financed
on
a
shoestring
that
people
are
wary
of
.

''

But
such
highly
leveraged
transactions
seemed
to
have
multiplied
this
year
,
casting
a
pall
over
much
of
the
junk
market
.

Michael
McNamara
,
director
of
fixed-income
research
at
Kemper
Financial
Services
,
says
the
quality
of
junk
issues
has
been
getting
poorer
,
contributing
to
the
slide
in
prices
.

``
Last
year

we
probably
bought
one
out
of
every
three
new
deals
,
''
he
says
.

``
This
year
,
at
best
,
it
's
in
one
in
every
five
or
six
.

And
our
credit
standards
have
n't
changed
one
iota
.

''
However
,
Mr.
McNamara
said
the
slide
in
junk
is
creating
``
one
hell
of
a
buying
opportunity
''
for
selective
buyers
.

For
the
moment
,
investors
seem
more
preoccupied
with
the
``
bad
''
junk
than
the
``
good
''
junk
.

``
The
market
has
been
weak
since
''
the
announcement
of
the
Campeau
cash
squeeze
and
the
company
's
subsequent
bailout
by
Olympia
&
York
,
says
Mr.
Minella
of
Merrill
Lynch
.

``
That
really
affected
the
market
in
that
people
started
to
ask
`

What
else
is
in
trouble
?

'
''

Well
before
Campeau
,
though
,
there
were
signs
that
the
junk
market
was
stumbling
through
one
of
its
worst
years
ever
.

Despite
the
relatively
strong
economy
,
junk
bond
prices
did
nothing
except
go
down
,
hammered
by
a
seemingly
endless
trail
of
bad
news
:

--
In
June
,
two
months
before
it
would
default
on
interest
payments
covering
some
of
its
$
1.2
billion
of
speculative
debt
securities
,
New
York-based
Integrated
Resources
Inc.
said
it
ran
out
of
borrowed
money
.

--
In
July
,
Southmark
Corp.
,
the
Dallas-based
real
estate
and
financial
services
company
with
about
$
1.3
billion
of
junk
bonds
,
voluntarily
filed
for
protection
under
U.S.
bankruptcy
law
.


--
By
the
end
of
July
,
the
difference
in
yield
between
an
index
of
junk
bonds
and
seven-year
Treasury
notes
widened
to
more
than
5.5
percentage
points
.

--
In
August
,
Resorts
International
Inc.
,
which
sold
more
than
$
500
million
of
junk
bonds
,
suspended
interest
payments
.

--
In
September
,
just
as
the
cash
squeeze
hit
Campeau
,
Lomas
Financial
Corp.
defaulted
on
$
145
million
of
notes
and
appeared
unlikely
to
pay
interest
on
a
total
of
$
1.2
billion
of
debt
securities
.

Meantime
,
regulators
are
becoming
increasingly
worried
as
the
rush
to
leverage
shows
no
signs
of
abating
.

Moody

's
says
the
frequency
of
corporate
credit
downgrades
is
the
highest

this
year
since
1982
.

In
addition
,
there
are
six
times
as
many
troubled
banks
as
there
were
in
the
recession
of
1981
,
according
to
the
Federal
Deposit
Insurance
Corp
.

``
The
era
of
the
1980s
is
about
compound
interest
and
the
reaching
for
it
,
''
says
James
Grant
,
editor
of
Grant
's
Interest
Rate
Observer
,
an
early
critic
of
the
junk
bond
market
.

``
What

we
've
begun
to
see
is
the
damage
to
businesses
of
paying
exorbitant
compound
interest
.

Businesses
were
borrowing
at
interest
rates
higher
than
their
own
earnings
.

What

we
're
seeing
now
is
the
wrenching
readjustment
of
asset
values
to
a
future
when
speculative-grade
debt
will
be
hard
to
obtain
rather
than
easy
.

Friday
's
Market
Activity

Prices
of
Treasury
bonds
surged
in
the
biggest
rally
of
the
year
as
investors
fled
a
plummeting
stock
market
.

The
benchmark
30-year
Treasury
bond
was
quoted
6
p.m.
EDT
at
103
,
compared
with
100
Thursday
,
up
2
points
.

The
yield
on
the
benchmark
fell
to
7.82
%
,
the
lowest
since
March
31
,
1987
,
according
to
Technical
Data
Global
Markets
Group
.

The
``
flight
to
quality
''
began
late
in
the
day
and
followed
a
precipitous
fall
in
the
stock
market
.

Treasurys
opened
lower
,
reacting
negatively
to
news
that
the
producer
price
index
--
a
measure
of
inflation
on
the
wholesale
level
--
accelerated
in
September
.

Bond
prices
barely
budged
until
midday
.

Many
bond
market
participants
will
be
closely
eying
the
action
of
the
Federal
Reserve
,
which
might
repeat
its
October
1987
injection
of
huge
amounts
of
liquidity
to
buoy
the
financial
markets
and
keep
the
economy
from
slowing
into
a
recession
.

Prices
of
municipals
,
investment-grade
corporates
and
mortgage-backed
bonds
also
rose
,
but
lagged
behind
their
Treasury
counterparts
.

Mortgage
securities
rose
in
hectic
trading
,
with
most
of
the
activity
concentrated
in
Government
National
Mortgage
Association
9
%
coupon
securities
,
the
most
liquid
mortgage
issue
.

The
Ginnie
Mae
November
9
%
issue
ended
at
98
,
up
point
on
the
day
,
to
yield
about
9.28
%
to
a
12-year
average
life
assumption
.

Investment-grade
corporate
bonds
were
up
about
to
point
.

But
the
yield
spread
between
lower-quality
,
investment-grade
issues
and
higher-quality
bonds
widened
.

And
the
yields
on
telephone
and
utility
issues
rose
relative
to
other
investment-grade
bonds
in
anticipation
of
this
week
's
$
3
billion
bond
offering
by
the
Tennessee
Valley
Authority
.

Despite
rumors
that
the
TVA
's
long-awaited
offering
would
be
postponed
because
of
the
debacle
in
the
equity
markets
,
sources
in
the
underwriting
syndicate
said
they
expect
the
issue
will
be
priced
as
scheduled
.

One
of
the
sources
said
the
smaller
portions
of
$
750
million
each
of
five-year
and
10-year
bonds
have
already
been
``
substantially
oversubscribed
.

''

Municipal
bonds
rose
as
much
as

Canadian
Imperial
Bank
of
Commerce
said
it
will
increase
its
loan-loss
provisions
to
cover
all
its
loans
to
lesser
developed
countries
,
except
Mexico
,
resulting
in
an
after-tax
charge
to
1989
earnings
of
300
million
Canadian
dollars
(
US$
255
million
)
.

Don
Bowder
,
senior
vice
president
and
chief
accountant
,
said
the
bank
's
strong
earnings
enable
it
to
be
the
first
major
Canadian
bank
to
set
aside
provisions
covering
all
its
C$
1.17
billion
in
non-Mexican
LDC
debt
.

``
It
eliminates
the
continuing
uncertainty
with
respect
to
the
ultimate
value
of
the
loans
,
''
he
said
.

The
bank
said
about
C$
525
million
will
be
added
to
its
existing
LDC
and
general
loss
provisions
in
its
fourth
quarter
,
ending
Oct.
31
.

Mr.
Bowder
said
the
C$
300
million
charge
to
earnings
would
amount
to
about
C$
1.34

a
share
.

The
bank
's
net
income
for
the
nine
months
ended
July
31
was
C$
577
million
,
or
C$
3.10

a
share
.

Mr.
Bowder
said
the
bank
will
restructure
its
C$
604
million
of
Mexican
debt
,
of
which

C$
255
million
is
in
Mexican
notes
secured
by
U.S.
government
bonds
.

The
bank
has
a
45
%
reserve
against
the
remaining
C$
349
million
of
Mexican
debt
and
expects
to
swap
that
for
other
Mexican
notes
supported
by
U.S.
Treasury
zero-coupon
bonds
.

Mr.
Bowder
said
the
bank
's
experience
with
LDC
debt
has
been
``
painful
''
and
this
latest
move
represents
the
final
phase
of
a
program
begun
seven
years
ago
to
reduce
its
exposure
through
provisioning
,
debt
sales
and
debt
swaps
.

He
said
the
bank
will
no
longer
participate
in
LDC
sovereign
lending
,
but
will
support
trade
financing
and
other
transactions

that
meet
the

standards

Chief
executive
officers
in
the
New
York
region
say
they
share
a
national
pessimism
about
the
economy
,
yet
are
bullish
on
their
own
prospects
,
according
to
a
study
of
business
executives
.

One
particularly
positive
note
in
the
study
of
chief
executives
in
the
tri-state
area
,
commissioned
by
National
Westminster
Bancorp
,
is
that
as
many
as
88
%
of
the
executives
intend
to
expand
their
businesses
or
at
least
maintain
employment
levels
in
1990
.

Employment
at
financial-related
companies
in
the
New
York
area
were
hit
hard
after
the
1987
stock
market
crash
.

The
survey
examined
the
opinions
of
550
randomly
selected
companies
in
the
New
York
metropolitan
area
--
Connecticut
,
Long
Island
,
New
York
City
,
Westchester
County
and
New
Jersey
--
with
annual
sales
between
$
5
million
and
$
250
million
.

Executives
in
the
area
have
grown
more
pessimistic
about
the
performance
of
the
national
economy
.

When
the
study
was
taken
in
1988
,
32
%
of
the
respondents
thought
the
national
economy
was
worse
that
year
than
the
year
before
,
while
in
1989
,
that
stance
was
taken
by
41
%
of
the
executives
.

The
pessimism
was
greater
among
the
larger
--
and
more
national
--
companies
.

Looking
ahead
,
the
majority
of
area
officials
expect
interest
rates
to
decline
and
inflation
to
rise
,
while
44
%
of
the
chief
executives
feel
a
recession
is
likely
by
the
end
of

On
the
regional
level
,
executives
had
less
good
news
to
report
about
their
own
businesses
.

Only
49
%
of
the
executives
reported
improved
company
performance

this
year
,
down
from
the
60
%
in
the
1988
study
.

Predictably
,
the
year
ahead
looks
brighter
;
63
%
of
the
executives
anticipate
better
company
performance
in
1990
,
while
only
10
%
envision
a
decline
.

A
good
sign
for
the
long-term
health
of
the
region
is
that
chief
executives
were
generally
``
quite
satisfied
''
with
the
region
as
a
business
place
,
saying
its
benefits
consistently
outweigh
drawbacks
.

Highest
marks
went
to
the
availability
of
professional
business
services
,
which

51
%
of
the
executives
consider
the
top
benefit
.

The
local
marketplace
and
availability
of
professional
employees
also
were
ranked
high
.

Among
major
drawbacks
to
the
region
,
63
%
consider
the
level
of
state
taxes
at
the
top
of
the
list
,
followed
by
54
%

who
had
the
same
opinion
on
local
taxes
.

Coming
in
third
,
40
%
said
it
was
the
cost
of
non-professional
employees
.

On
questions
of
employment
,
40
%
of
the
executives
increased
their
work
force
since
last
year
,
and
44
%
expect
to
expand
next
year
.

Only
9
%
reduced
their
payrolls
in
the
past
year
.

For
the
second
year
in
a
row
,
New
Jersey
was
rated
as
the
region
's
most
desirable
place
to
do
business
.

Among
all
of
the
executives
surveyed
who
would
consider
a
move
,
50
%
would
look
at
New
Jersey
,
compared
with
an
average
23
%

who
would
consider
other
states
in
the
region
.

In
one
of
the
highest
degrees
of
loyalty
shown
in
the
study
,
of
those
New
Jersey
executives
considering
a
move
,
74
%
would
stay
within
the
state
.

But
one-fourth
of
the
state
's
executives
listed
transportation
problems
as
a
drawback
.

Chief
executives
in
New
York
City
showed
a
noticeably
high
expectation
of
improved
company
performance
in
the
next
year
.

In
New
York
,
75
%
of
the
executives
predict
their
companies
'
performance
will
improve
in
1990
,
compared
with
an
average
of
63
%
from
chief
executives
from
the
other
locales

who
feel
the
same
way
.

Westchester
executives
reflected
the
most
bullish
prospects
for
employment
.

More
companies
in
Westchester
than
any
other
location
have
increased
the
number
of
their
employees
in
the
past
year
.

In
1990
,
Westchester
chief
executives
lead
the
way
in
plans
to
increase
their
number
of
employees
.

In
Westchester
,
51
%
of
the
executives
anticipate
hiring
more
,
while
in
Long
Island

that
number
was
39
%
and
in
Connecticut
42
%
.

``
I

as
it
launches
into
a
15-second

on
its
own

The

the

about
$

that

course
,
and
seem
to
disappear
,
only
to
mutate
and
afflict
public
life
anew
.

The
disease
metaphor
comes
to
mind
,
of
course
,
not
as
an
aspersion
on
the
advocates
of
national
service
.

Rather
,
it
is
born
of
frustration
with
having
to
combat
constantly
changing
strains
of
a
statist
idea
that
one
thought
had
been
eliminated
in
the
early
1970s
,
along
with
smallpox
.

It
is
back
with
us
again
,
in
the
form
of
legislation
to
pay
volunteers
under
a
``
National
and
Community
Service
Act
,
''
a
proposal
with
a
serious
shot
at
congressional
passage

this
fall
.

Why
does
the
national-service
virus
keep
coming
back
?

Perhaps
it
is
because
utopian
nostalgia
evokes
both
military
experience
and
the
social
gospel
.

If
only
we
could
get
America
's
wastrel
youth
into
at
least
a
psychic
uniform

we
might
be
able
to
teach
self-discipline
again
and
revive
the
spirit
of
giving
.

A
quarter
of
a
century
ago
national
service
was
promoted
as
a
way
of
curing
the
manifest
inequities
of
the
draft
--
by
,
of
all
things
,
expanding
the
draft
.

Those
of
us

who
resisted
the
idea
then
suspect
today
that
an
obligation
of
government
service
for
all
young
people
is
still
the
true
long-term
aim
of
many
national-service
backers
,
despite
their
protests
that
present
plans
contain
no
coercion
.

Choice
of
the
volunteer
military
in
the
1970s
seemed
to
doom
national
service
as
much
as
the
draft
.

But
the
virus
was
kept
alive
in
sociology
departments
until
a
couple
of
years
ago
,
when
it
again
was
let
loose
.

This
time

it
attempted
to
invade
two
connected
problems
,
the
rising
cost
of
higher
education
and
the
rising
expense
to
the
federal
government
of
educational
grants
and
loans
.

Why
not
keep
and
even
expand
the
loans
and
grants
,
the
advocates
reasoned
,
but
require
some
form
of
service
from
each
recipient
?

Military
service
,
moreover
,
could
be
a
national-service
option
.

Thus
,
undoubtedly
it
was
hoped
that
the
new
strain
of
national
service
would
prove
contagious
,
infecting
patriotic
conservatives
,
pay-as-you-go
moderates
,
and
idealistic
liberals
.

The
Democratic
Leadership
Council
,
a
centrist
group
sponsoring
the
plan
,
surely
thought
it
might
help
the
party
to
attract
support
,
especially
among
college
students
and
their
parents
.

A
provision
allowing
grants
to
be
applied
to
first-home
purchases
was
added
to
appeal
to
those

who
had
had
enough
of
schooling
.

The
DLC
plan
envisaged
``
volunteers
''
planting
trees
,
emptying
bedpans
,
tutoring
children
,
and
assisting
librarians
for
$
100

a
week
,
tax
free
,
plus
medical
care
.

With
a
tax-free
$
10,000
voucher
payment
at
the
end
of
each
year
,
the
volunteers
would
be
making
a
wage
comparable
to
$
17,500

a
year
.

Mind
you
,
most
of
``
the
volunteers
''
would
be
unskilled
17
-
to
18-year-olds
,
some
not
even
high
school
graduates
,
and
many
saving
money
by
living
at
home
.

They
would
be
doing
better
financially
under
national
service
than
many
taxpayers
working
at
the
same
kinds
of
jobs
and
perhaps
supporting
families
.

As
it
happened
,
political
resistance
developed
among
educational
and
minority
interests

that
count
on
the
present
education
grant
system
,
so
the
national-service
devotees
decided
to
abandon
the
supposedly
crucial
principle
of
``
give
in
order
to
get
.

''
Opposition
to
national
service
from
the
Pentagon
,
which
wants
to
protect
its
own
recruitment
process
,
also
led
to
the
military-service
option
being
dropped
.

Clearly
,
a
new
rationale
for
national
service
had
to
be
cooked
up
.

What

better
place
to
turn
than
Sen.
Edward
Kennedy
's
Labor
Committee
,
that
great
stove
of
government
expansionism
,
where
many
a
stagnant
pot
of
porridge
is
kept
on
the
back
burner
until
it
can
be
brought
forward
and
presented
as
nouvelle
cuisine
?

In
this
case
,
the
new
recipe
for
national
service
called
for
throwing
many
assorted
legislative
leftovers
into
one
kettle
:
a
demonstration
project
for
educational
aid
(
particularly
satisfying
to
the
DLC
and
Sen.
Sam
Nunn
)
,
a
similar
demonstration
program
for
youth
conservation
(
a
la
Sen.
Chris
Dodd
)
,
a
competitive
grants
program
to
states
to
spark
youth
and
senior
citizen
volunteer
projects
(
a
Kennedy
specialty
)
,
a
community
service
work-study
program
for
students
(
pleasing
to
the
palate
of
Sen.
Dale
Bumpers
,
among
others
)
,
plus
engorgement
of
the
VISTA
volunteer
program
and
the
Retired
Senior
Volunteer
,
Foster
Grandparent
,
and
Senior
Companion
programs
.

Before
the
menu
is
printed
,
the
House
may
add
more
ingredients
,
also
changing
the
initial
price
,
now
posted
at
some
$
330
million
.

It
is
widely
known
that
``
too
many
cooks
spoil
the
broth
,
''
but
that
wisdom
does
not
necessarily
reflect
the
view
of
the
cooks
,
especially
if
they
are
senators
.

The
``
omnibus
''
bill
coming
out
of
Congress
may
be
unwholesome
glop
,
but
the
assorted
chefs
are
happy
and
the
restaurant
is
pushing
the
dish
very
hard
.

The
aroma
of
patronage
is
in
the
air
.

Is
the
voluntary
sector
so
weak
that
it
needs
such
unsolicited
assistance
?

On
the
contrary
,
it
is
as
robust
as
ever
.

According
to
the
Gallup
Poll
,
American
adults
contribute
an
average
of
two
hours

a
week
of
service
,
while
financial
contributions
to
charity
in
the
1980s
have
risen
30
%
(
adjusted
for
inflation
)
.

Even
if
government
does
see
various
``
unmet
needs
,
''
national
service
is
not
the
way
to
meet
them
.

If
we
want
to
support
students
,
we
might
adopt
the
idea
used
in
other
countries
of
offering
more
scholarships
based
on
something
called
``
scholarship
,
''
rather
than
on
the
government
's
idea
of
``
service
.

''
Or
we
might
provide
a
tax
credit
for
working
students
.

What

we
do
not
need
to
do
is
start
a
war
,
and
then
try
to
justify
it
by
creating
a
GI
Bill
.

To
the
extent

we
lack
manpower
to
staff
menial
jobs
in
hospitals
,
for
example
,
we
should
raise
pay
,
pursue
labor-saving
technology
,
or
allow
more
legal
immigration
,
rather
than
overpay
high
school
graduates
as
short-term
workers
and
cause
resentment
among
permanent
workers
paid
lesser
amounts
to
do
the
same
jobs
.

Will
national
service
,
in
the
current
highly
politicized
and
opportunistic
form
exert
enough
appeal
to
get
adopted
?

Not
necessarily
.

Polls
show
wide
,
generalized
support
for
some
vague
concept
of
service
,
but
the
bill
now
under
discussion
lacks
any
passionate
public
backing
.

Nonetheless
,
Senate
Democrats
are
organizing
a
roll
of
supporting
``
associations
,
''
``
societies
''
and
``
councils
,
''
some
of
which
may
hope
to
receive
the
paid
``
volunteers
.

''

So
far
,
the
president
seems
ill-disposed
to
substitute
any
of
the
omnibus
for
his
own
free-standing
proposal
to
endow
a
``
Points
of
Light
''
foundation
with
$
25
million
to
inform
citizens
of
all
ages
and
exhort
them
to
genuine
volunteerism
.

However
,
even
this
admirable
plan
could
become
objectionable
if
the
White
House
gives
in
to
congressional
Democratic
pressure
to
add
to
the
scope
of
the
president
's
initiative
or
to
involve
the
independent
foundation
in
``
brokering
''
federal
funds
for
volunteer
projects
.

There
's
no
need
for
such
concessions
.

The
omnibus
can
be
defeated
,
the
virus
controlled
,
and
real
service
protected
.

National
service
,
the
utopian
idea
,
still
wo
n't
go
away
then
,
of
course
,
but
the
millions
of
knee-socked
youth
performing
works
of
``
civic
content
''
will
be
mobilized
only
in
the
imagination
of
their
progenitors
.

Mr.
Chapman
is
a
fellow
at
the
Indianapolis-based
Hudson
Institute

This
article
is
adapted
from
remarks
at
a
Hoover
Institution
conference
on
national
service
,
in
which

Mr.
Szanton
also
participated
.

``
In
our
business
,
''
says
Groupe
Bull
Chairman
Francis
Lorentz
,
``
one
and
one
sometimes
add
up
to
1.1
,
or
1.2
,
but
rarely
two
.

''

Mr.
Lorentz
is
talking
about
mergers
,
not
mathematics
.

Bull
,
the
French-government-owned
computer
maker
,
earlier
this
month
agreed
to
buy
the
computer
business
of
Zenith
Electronics
Corp.
for
as
much
as
$
635
million
,
but
denies
this
is
a
merger
.

Bull
says
it
intends
to
retain
existing
management
of
the
U.S.
unit
and
keep
the
Zenith
label
,
while
selling
Zenith
personal
computers
--
a
product
line
in
which

Bull
had
been
lagging
--
as
part
of
Bull
data-processing
systems
.

Merger
or
not
,
the
Zenith
acquisition
is
a
key
part
of
Mr.
Lorentz
's
plan
to
grow
Bull
--
the
world
's
11th
biggest
computer
company
last
year
--
into
a
profitable
member
of
the
top
five
or
six
computer
makers
.

It
wo
n't
be
easy
.

Bull
had
a
first-half
net
loss
of
537
million
francs
(
$
82.7
million
)
on
revenue
of
14
billion
francs
(
$
2.16
billion
)
.

Mr.
Lorentz
says
his
objective
remains
posting
a
small
profit
for
this
year
,
but
he
is
n't
certain
the
company
will
make
it
into
the
black
.

He
adds
that
any
full-year
loss
wo
n't
be
``
anywhere
as
big
''
as
the
first-half
loss
,
which
was
caused
in
part
by
production
problems
,
``
which
are
being
solved
,
''
at
the
company
's
Angers
,
France
,
circuit-board
plant
and
a
squeeze
on
profit
margins
because
of
growing
competition
.

In
any
event
,
Bull
thus
far
has
n't
had
any
trouble
finding
the
cash
to
fund
its
acquisitions
.

Bull
posted
a
profit
in
1988
of
303
million
francs
on
revenue
of
31.55
billion
francs
.

The
other
key
to
Bull
's
future
health
is
its
other
U.S.
leg
.

Bull
last
year
increased
to
69.4
%
its
controlling
interest
in
Honeywell
Bull
Inc
.

Honeywell
Inc.
retains
15.6
%
,
and
NEC
Corp.
of
Japan
owns
the
remaining
15
%
.

In
addition
,
Bull
renamed
the
U.S.
company
Bull
HN
Information
Services
Inc
.

Bull
HN
reports
to
Mr.
Lorentz
as
chairman
of
holding
company
Cie.
des
Machines
Bull
.

During
the
past
decade
or
so
,
Bull
and
Honeywell
tried
various
approaches
to
combining
their
businesses
,
none
of
which
really
jelled
.

``
We
were
spending
all
our
energies
internally
,
while
externally
the
world
was
changing
at
breakneck
speed
,
''
Mr.
Lorentz
says
.

But
now
,
with
Bull
in
firm
control
,
these
U.S.
operations
are
key
ingredients
in
Mr.
Lorentz
's
plans
to
ensure
that
Bull
remains
one
of
the
half-dozen
or
so
world-wide
,
full-range
computer
companies
likely
to
survive
the
1990s
.

To
do
so
,
Bull
is
planting
itself
firmly
in
the
U.S.
,
where
,
says
Mr.
Lorentz
,
a
lot
of
the
best
people
and
research
are
.

The
Zenith
buy
means
Bull
will
derive
22
%
of
its
revenue
from
the
U.S.
--
up
from
18
%
previously
--
and
the
company
spends
30
%
of
its
3.64
billion-franc
research
and
development
budget
in
the
U.S
.

Keeping
Zenith
relatively
independant
,
says
Mr.
Lorentz
,
makes
sense
because
``
they
are
completely
different
cultures
,
making
personal
computers
,
like
Zenith
,
and
making
mainframes
like
Bull
.

''
He
says
disarmingly
:
``
We
are
n't
fast
enough
.

We
{
mainframe
makers
}
live
in
cycles
of
four
or
five
years
of
development
and
product
life
.

They
{
PC
makers
}
get
six
months
of
development
and
maybe
12
months
of
shelf
life
.

They
can
afford
to
take
some
risks
and
fail
.

''

``
It
is
absolutely
essential
to
keep
Zenith
's
originality
,
its
extraordinary
force
,
''
the
47-year-old
Mr.
Lorentz
adds
.

``
Our
vocation
is
to
be
able
to
respond
to
any
question
our
clients
ask
,
''
says
Mr.
Lorentz
,
who
joined
Bull
seven
years
ago
after
stints
as
chief
financial
officer
of
a
water
company
and
various
posts
in
the
French
Treasury
.

``
We
want
to
be
able
to
offer
complete
systems
in
specialized
areas
,
like
banking
,
ranging
from
the
automated-teller
machines
to
the
front-desk
workstation
to
the
back-office
equipment
to
the
mainframe
computer
.

To
do
these

we
need
to
make
all
the
basic
building
blocks
.

''

Mr.
Lorentz
succeeded
Jacques
Stern
as
chairman
of
Bull
in
June
,
and
like
his
predecessor
,
he
is
a
crusader
for
``
open
software
''
--
that
is
standards

that
will
work
on
the
machines
of
various
makers
--
in
order
to
give
smaller
companies
like
Bull

a
chance
against
industry
giants
.

Mr.
Lorentz
,
Mr.
Stern
's
No.
2
since
1982
,
inherits
the
task
of
making
Bull

the
biggest
and
healthiest
European
soup-to-nuts
computer
company
,
competing
globally
with
the
likes
of
International
Business
Machines
Corp.
,
Unisys
Corp.
,
and
a
handful
of
Japanese
companies
.

Counting
only
sales
of
computer
equipment
,
Bull
is
already
the
biggest
in
Europe
,
ahead
of
Siemens
AG
of
West
Germany
and
Ing
.

C.
Olivetti
&
Co.
of
Italy
,
Mr.
Lorentz
says
.

Mr.
Lorentz
,
an
intense
,
cerebral
product
of
France
's
elite
``
Ecole
National
d'Administration
''
likes
to
go
rock
climbing
in
his
spare
time
,
and
used
to
practice
the
martial
art
of
aikido
.

He
will
discuss
frankly
Bull
's
past
problems
;
when
asked
if
the
company
has
suffered
from
an
unfocussed
image
,
he
readily
agrees
.

He
allows
that
the
products
of
all
computer
makers
are
getting
more
and
more
alike
--
``
a
certain
banalization
''
he
calls
it
--
and
that
specialized
service
will
make
the
difference
in
the
future
.

``
How
we
manage
the
problem
of
service
will
make
all
the
difference
between
now
and
1995
,
''
he
says
.

After
having
added
Zenith
PCs
to
the
Bull
stable
,
Mr.
Lorentz
says
,
the
company
will
be
better
armed
for
battle
especially
in
Europe
.

``
Our
biggest
asset
is
that
we
are
well
implanted
in
Europe
,
and
Europe
will
be
the
fastest
growing
market
in
the
world
over
the
next
10
years
.

''
But
the
conquest
of
Europe
will
happen
,
in
part
,
from
the
U.S
.

``
The
information
industry
is
global
,
''
says
Mr.
Lorenz
,
``
but
the
image
of
that
industry
is
created
in
the
U.S.
,
so
we
must
be
present
in
the
U.S.
in
order
to
be
known
everywhere
else
.

The
U.S.
represents
45
%
of
the
world
information
market
,
so
it
's
45
%
of
our
world
.

The
technology
and
the
human
resources
are
there
,
and
since
the
scarcest
resource
for
us
is
people
,
and
the
people
are
in
the
U.S.
,
so
are
we
.

That
's
the
whole
story
.

''


Bolstered
by
a
robust
long-distance
business
,
the
telephone
industry
is
expected
to
post
a
healthy
profit
increase
for
the
third
quarter
.

Analysts
estimate
that
third-quarter
earnings
for
the
industry
will
increase
as
much
as
19
%
from
the
year-earlier
period
.

If
so
,
their
cumulative
earnings
could
hit
$
4.12
billion
.

Most
of
the
earnings
growth
,
however
,
will
come
from
the
long-distance
sector
.

American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
Co.
is
expected
to
post
a
profit
increase
of
about
18
%
and
MCI
Communications
Corp.
's
earnings
are
expected
to
surge
58
%
.

United
Telecommunications
Inc.
reported
last
Wednesday
that
third-quarter
net
income
climbed
75
%
to
$
94.6
million
,
or
90
cents

a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
1.93
billion
.

United
Telecom
's
Sprint
unit
posted
operating
profit
of
$
60
million
.

Paul
Aran
,
a
telecommunications
analyst
with
Bear
,
Stearns
&
Co.
,
said
the
long-distance
companies
have
been
buoyed
by
strong
growth
in
the
facsimile
and
data-service
business
.

He
said
declining
long-distance
prices
also
have
helped
stimulate
usage
.

The
local
telephone
companies
,
however
,
are
n't
expected
to
fare
as
well
.

Growth
is
predicted
to
be
in
the
1
%
to
2
%
range
for
most
companies
,
with
Southern
New
England
Telephone
and
GTE
Corp.
posting
profit
increases
in
the
neighborhood
of
10
%
.

``
The
long-distance
companies
have
kept
their
momentum
,
''
says
Robert
Morris
III
,
a
telecommunications
analyst
with
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
,
``
while
the
pace
of
growth
for
the
local
telephone
companies
is
slowing
.

''
That
's
especially
true
for
the
regional
Bell
companies
.

He
said
regulation
is
primarily
responsible
for
the
Bells
'
dull
earnings
growth
.

Most
companies
have
reached
their
maximum
allowed
earnings
ceilings
,
which
are
set
by
regulators
.

``
This
signals
the
need
for
regulatory
change
,
''
Mr.
Morris
said
.

Pacific
Telesis
Group
,
which
is
expected
to
post
earnings
of
about
75
cents

a
share
,
obtained
regulatory
relief
from
California
regulators
last
week
.

Under
the
plan
,
the
company
is
allowed
to
earn
more
if
it
can
operate
more
efficiently
.

In
the
year-earlier
quarter
,
Pacific
Telesis
earned
$
318
million
,
or
75
cents

a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
2.38
billion
.

Analysts
expect
installations
of
new
telephone
lines
to
grow
about
3
%
.

However
,
GTE
,
BellSouth
Corp.
and
Pacific
Telesis
,
which
operate
in
territories
with
hearty
economies
,
are
expected
to
report
new-telephone-line
growth
in
the
range
of
4
%
to
5
%
.

Nynex
Corp.
's
profits
could
begin
to
show
signs
of
weakening
from
the
effects
of
a
nearly
three-month
strike
,
while
other
Bell
companies
,
such
as
Ameritech
and
Southwestern
Bell
Corp.
,
could
be
hurt
in
the
quarter
by
one-time
charges
associated
with
the
settlement
of
new
union
contracts
.

Mr.
Aran
,
the
Bear
Stearns
analyst
,
said
that
generally
,
after
eight
weeks
,
``
A
strike
starts
hurting
earnings
.

I
'm
waiting
to
see
what

the
impact
is
on
Nynex
.

''

Analysts
predict
Nynex
earnings
will
be
about
$
1.57

a
share
,
compared
with
$
1.72

a
share

a
year
earlier
,
when
the
company
earned
$
338.9
million
on
sales
of
$
3.18
billion
.

The
independent
telephone
companies
also
may
post
third-quarter
results

that
trail
the
comparable
year-ago
period
.

Rochester
Telephone
Co.
,
for
instance
,
said
it
expects
third-quarter
earnings
to
be
``
somewhat
lower
''
than
the
year-earlier
quarter
--
even
though
the
company
expects
to
post
an
extraordinary
gain
of
50
cents
during
the
period
.

The
company
said
higher
expenses
and
competitive
pressures
hampered
earnings
.

For
the
1988
third
quarter
,
Rochester
Telephone
reported
a
net
income
of
$
12.9
million
,
or
$
1.10

a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
120.2
million
.

Giant
Group
Ltd.
said
it
terminated
negotiations
for
the
purchase
of
Aspen
Airways
,
a
Denver-based
regional
carrier

that
operates
the
United
Express
connector
service
under
contract
to
UAL
Corp.
's
United
Airlines
.

Giant
,
a
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif.
,
collection
of
companies

that
is
controlled
by
Hollywood
producer
Burt
Sugarman
,
did
n't
give
a
reason
for
halting
its
plan
to
acquire
the
airline
,
and
Aspen
officials
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

Giant
agreed
last
month
to
purchase
the
carrier
.

Giant
has
n't
ever
disclosed
the
proposed
price
,
although
Avmark
Inc.
,
an
Arlington
,
Va.-based
aircraft
consulting
concern
,
has
valued
Aspen
's
fleet
at
about
$
46
million
.

The
airline
would
have
become
the
latest
in
a
peculiar
blend
of
Giant
companies
,
which
are
involved
in
making
cement
,
recycling
newsprint
and
operating
fast-food
restaurants
.

Coldwell
Banker
Commercial
Group
said
it
sold
$
47
million
of
common
stock
to
its
employees
at
$
10

a
share
,
giving
them

a
total
stake
of
more
than
40
%
in
the
commercial
real
estate
brokerage
firm
.

The
firm
,
which
was
acquired
in
April
from
Sears
,
Roebuck
&
Co.
in
a
management-led
buy-out
,
had
planned
to
sell
up
to
$
56.4
million
of
stock
,
or
a
50
%
stake
in
the
company
,
to
its
5,000
employees
.

Though
the
offering
did
n't
sell
out
,
James
J.
Didion
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
,
said
,
``
We
're
pretty
proud
of
the
employees
'
response
.

''
He
noted
that
unlike
an
employee
stock
ownership
plan
,
where
a
company
usually
borrows
money
from
third
party
lenders
to
buy
stock
that
it
sets
aside
to
award
employees
over
time
,
here
employees
had
to
fork
out
their
own
cash
for
the
stock
.

``
They
came
up
with
their
own
money
instead
of
borrowed
money
,
''
Mr.
Didion
said
.

``
It
's
totally
different
.

''

He
said
the
offering
was
designed
to
create
long-term
incentives
for
employees
.

``
We
're
in
a
service
business
,
and
in
that
context
,
it
's
vital
to
have
your
employees
involved
in
the
ownership
so
they
have
a
stake
in
the
success
.

''
The
brokerage
firm
wo
n't
pay
a
dividend
on
the
stock
.

Employees
have
the
right
to
trade
stock
among
themselves
,
and
the
company
will
establish
an
internal
clearing
house
for
these
transactions
.

They
may
also
eventually
sell
the
shares
to
third
parties
,
but
the
outside
investors

who
own
the
remaining
60
%
of
Coldwell
Banker
have
the
right
to
first
refusal
.

Those
outside
investors
in
Coldwell
Banker
include
Carlyle

,
a
closely
held
Washington

merchant
banking

Coldwell

also
named
three
outside

nominees
for
its

member

.

The
nominees
are
Gary

,
chief

Robert
L.
Corcoran
Jr.
,

,
was
named
managing
director
and
regional
manager
of
Japan

at

The

by

Morrison
,
a
managing
director
in
the
international-money-markets

Striking
auto
workers
ended
their
19-day
occupation
of
a
metal
shop
at
a
Peugeot
S.A.
factory
in
eastern
France
Friday
as
pay
talks
got
under
way
in
the
capital
.

But
the
Peugeot
breakthrough
came
as
a
nationwide
dispute
by
Finance
Ministry
employees
disrupted
border
checkpoints
and
threatened
the
government
's
ability
to
pay
its
bills
.

The
Peugeot
metalworkers
began
filing
out
of
the
shop
,
which
makes
auto
parts
,
at
the
plant
in
Mulhouse
after
voting
589
to
193
to
abandon
the
occupation
.

Their
withdrawal
was
based
on
promises
by
Peugeot
to
open
negotiations
in
Paris
at
the
same
time

the
last
man
left
the
premises
.

The
strike
by
customs
officers
,
tax
collectors
,
treasury
workers
and
other
civil
servants
attached
to
the
Ministry
of
Finance
may
pose
a
more
serious
challenge
to
the
government
and
the
average
Frenchman
.

Ministry
employees
complain
that
they
are
poorly
paid
because
of
a
complex
job-rating
system

they
say
fails
to
take
into
account
their
education
and
level
of
technical
expertise
.

Government
officials
here
and
in
other
countries
laid
plans
through
the
weekend
to
head
off
a
Monday
market
meltdown
--
but
went
out
of
their
way
to
keep
their
moves
quiet
.

Federal
Reserve
Chairman
Alan
Greenspan
was
on
the
telephones
,
making
it
clear
to
officials
in
the
U.S.
and
abroad
that
the
Fed
was
prepared
to
inject
massive
amounts
of
money
into
the
banking
system
,
as
it
did
in
October
1987
,
if
the
action
were
needed
to
prevent
a
financial
crisis
.

And
at
the
Treasury
,
Secretary
Nicholas
Brady
talked
with
friends
and
associates
on
Wall
Street
while
Assistant
Secretary
David
Mullins
carefully
analyzed
data
on
the
Friday
market
plunge
.

But
the
officials
feared
that
any
public
announcements
would
only
increase
market
jitters
.

In
addition
,
officials
at
the
Fed
and
in
the
Bush
administration
decided
that
avoiding
overt
actions
and
statements
over
the
weekend
would
give
them
more
strength
and
flexibility
should
Friday
's
market
drop
turn
into
this
morning
's
rout
.

``
The
disadvantage
at
this
point
is
that

anything

you
do
that
looks
like
you
are
doing
too
much
tends
to
reinforce
a
sense
of
crisis
,
''
said
one
government
official
,
insisting
on
anonymity
.

The
Fed
's
efforts
at
secrecy
were
partly
foiled
Sunday
morning
,
when
both

the
New
York
Times
and
the
Washington
Post
carried
stories
quoting
a
senior
Fed
official
saying
the
central
bank
was
prepared
to
pour
cash
into
the
banking
system
Monday
morning
.

Fed
Chairman
Greenspan
was
surprised
by
both

stories
,
according
to
knowledgeable
sources
,
and
insisted
he
had
n't
authorized
any
public
comment
.

Nevertheless
,
Fed
officials
acknowledged
the
stories
were
reasonably
accurate
portrayals
of
the
central
bank
's
game
plan
.

It
is
prepared
to
assume
the
same
role

it
played
in
October
1987
,
providing
money
to
the
markets
if
necessary
to
keep
the
financial
system
afloat
.

The
Fed
provides
money
to
the
banking
system
by
buying
government
securities
from
financial
institutions
.

The
reticence
of
federal
officials
was
evident
in
the
appearance
Sunday
of
Budget
Director
Richard
Darman
on
ABC
's
``
This
Week
.

''
``
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
Brady
and
Chairman
Greenspan
and
the
chairman
of
the
SEC
and
others
have
been
in
close
contact
.

I
'm
sure
they
'll
do
what
's
right
,
what
's
prudent
,
what
's
sensible
,
''
he
said
.

When
it
was
suggested
his
comment
was
a
``
non-answer
,
''
Mr.
Darman
replied
:
``
It
is
a
non-answer
.

But
,
in
this
context
,
that
's
the
smart
thing
to
do
.

''

At
the
Treasury
,
Secretary
Brady
issued
a
statement
minimizing
the
stock
market
's
drop
.

``
Today
's
stock
market
decline
does
n't
signal
any
fundamental
change
in
the
condition
of
the
economy
,
''
he
said
.

``
The
economy
remains
well-balanced
,
and
the
outlook
is
for
continued
moderate
growth
.

''

But
administration
officials
conceded
that
Friday
's
drop
carried
the
chance
of
further
declines

this
week
.

``
One
possibility
is
that
this
is
a
surgical
setback
,
reasonably
limited
in
its
breadth
,
and
not
a
major
problem
,
''
said
one
senior
administration
official
,
who
also
asked
that
he
not
be
named
.

``
The
other
is
that
we
see
another
major
disaster
,
like
two
years
ago
.

I
think
that
's
less
likely
.

''

Nevertheless
,
Fed
Chairman
Greenspan
and
Vice
Chairman
Manuel
Johnson
were
in
their
offices
Sunday
evening
,
monitoring
events
as
they
unfolded
in
markets
around
the
world
.

The
action
was
expected
to
begin
with
the
opening
of
the
New
Zealand
foreign
exchange
markets
at
5
p.m.
EST
--
when
stocks
there
plunged
--
and
to
continue
as
the
trading
day
began
later
in
the
evening
in
Tokyo
and
through
early
this
morning
in
Europe
.

Both

the
Treasury
and
the
Fed
planned
to
keep
market
rooms
operating
throughout
the
night
to
monitor
the
developments
.

In
Tokyo
,
share
prices
dropped
sharply
by
1.7
%
in
early
Monday
morning
trading
.

After
the
initial
slide
,
the
market
appeared
to
be
turning
around
but
by
early
afternoon
was
headed
lower
.

In
the
Bush
administration
,
the
lead
is
being
taken
by
Treasury
Secretary
Brady
,
Undersecretary
Robert
Glauber
and
Assistant
Secretary
Mullins
.

The
three
men
worked
together
on
the
so-called
Brady
Commission
,
headed
by
Mr.
Brady
,
which
was
established
after
the
1987
crash
to
examine
the
market
's
collapse
.

As
a
result

they
have
extensive
knowledge
in
financial
markets
,
and
financial
market
crises
.

Mr.
Brady
was
at
the
White
House
Friday
afternoon
when
the
stock
market
's
decline
began
.

He
was
quickly
on
the
phone
with
Mr.
Mullins
,
who
in
turn
was
talking
with
the
chairmen
of
the
New
York
and
Chicago
exchanges
.

Later
,
Mr.
Brady
phoned
Mr.
Greenspan
,
SEC
Chairman
Richard
Breeden
and
numerous
contacts
in
New
York
and
overseas
.

Aides
say
he
continued
to
work
the
phones
through
the
weekend
.

Administration
officials
say
President
Bush
was
briefed
throughout
Friday
afternoon
and
evening
,
even
after
leaving
for
Camp
David
.

He
had
frequent
telephone
consultations
with
Mr.
Brady
and
Michael
Boskin
,
chairman
of
the
counsel
of
economic
advisers
.

Government
officials
tried
throughout
the
weekend
to
render
a
business-as-usual
appearance
in
order
to
avoid
any
sense
of
panic
.

Treasury
Undersecretary
David
Mulford
,
for
instance
,
was
at
a
meeting
of
the
Business
Council
in
Hot
Springs
,
Va.
,
when
the
stock
market
fell
,
and
remained
there
through
the
following
day
.

And
as
of
last
night
,
Fed
Chairman
Greenspan
had
n't
canceled
his
plans
to
address
the
American
Bankers
Association
convention
in
Washington
at
10
a.m.

this
morning
.

Ironically
,
Mr.
Greenspan
was
scheduled
to
address
the
same
convention

returned
to

The
dollar
drifted
lower
in
indecisive
trading
,
its
strength
sapped
by
concern
that
the
Federal
Reserve
is
gently
easing
monetary
policy
.

Despite
reserve-draining
operations
by
the
Fed
yesterday
and
on
the
three
preceding
business
days
,
some
analysts
say
the
central
bank
is
subtly
relaxing
credit
.

They
say
the
Fed
's
draining
operations
have
been
necessary
to
address
a
seasonal
surfeit
of
reserves
,
but
note
that
the
actions
have
n't
been
tough
enough
to
prevent
the
federal
funds
rate
from
easing
to
about
8
%
from
its
recent
level
of
9
%
.

The
federal
funds
rate
is
the
overnight
rate
banks
charge
each
other
.

``
They
're
draining
in
a
consistently
less
aggressive
manner
and
at
a
lower
level
,
''
said
James
T.
McGroarty
,
a
senior
vice
president
at
Greenwich
Capital
Markets
.

But
others
analysts
say
opinion
differs
markedly
on
whether
the
Fed
is
softening
its
credit
stance
,
noting
that
the
market
's
muted
reaction
reflects
this
division
.

``
We
just
do
n't
know
enough
yet
to
definitively
say
that
the
Fed
has
eased
...

the
fed
funds
rate
still
is
in
a
band
around
9
%
,
''
said
one
economist
.

Speculation
that
the
Fed
would
sharply
ease
its
credit
reins
was
damped
earlier
this
week
when
Chairman
Alan
Greenspan
said
central
banks
should
n't
focus
too
much
on
intermediate
goals
for
exchange
rates
and
interest
rates
.

In
late
New
York
trading
Thursday
,
the
dollar
was
quoted
at
1.9083
marks
,
down
from
1.9166
marks
late
Wednesday
,
and
at
144.17
yen
,
down
from
144.57
yen
late
Wednesday
.

Sterling
was
quoted
at
$
1.5523
,
up
from
$
1.5463
.

In
Tokyo
Friday
,
the
U.S.
currency
opened
for
trading
at
143.60
yen
,
down
from
Thursday
's
Tokyo
close
of
144.60
yen
.

Many
foreign
exchange
traders
remain
skeptical
that
a
credit-softening
is
in
the
offing
.

They
plan
to
look
for
clues
in
two
economic
indicators
due
out
today
,
one
on
the
producer-price
index
and
the
other
on
retail
sales
,
both
for
September
.

``
The
market
believes
PPI
will
confirm
Greenspan
's
concern
about
inflation
,
''
said
Francoise
Soares-Kemp
,
a
vice
president
with
Credit
Suisse
in
New
York
.

She
said
the
market
has
already
reacted
to
``
that
particular
prompting
''
and
is
unlikely
to
bid
the
dollar
significantly
higher
.

Higher
energy
and
auto
prices
are
expected
to
have
pushed
producer
prices
up
0.3
%
in
September
after
declining
in
August
and
July
.

Retail
sales
are
expected
to
have
remained
flat
in
September
,
according
to
economists
,
following
gains
of
0.7
%
in
August
and
0.5
%
in
July
.

A
long-awaited
speech
by
British
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
Nigel
Lawson
failed
to
bolster
the
flagging
pound
and
left
many
market
participants
with
a
decidedly
bearish
view
of
sterling
.

Vowing
to
continue
his
government
's
strategy
of
combating
inflation
with
high
interest
rates
,
Mr.
Lawson
told
the
Conservative
Party
conference
that
the
battle
to
rein
in
inflation
required
a
strong
currency
.

The
Tories
are
``
not
the
party
of
devaluation
,
''
he
said
.

But
Mr.
Lawson
failed
to
outline
specific
policy
changes
or
say
how
the
British
government
planned
to
support
the
beleaguered
pound
.

He
also
avoided
any
mention
of
when
London
would
bring
sterling
into
the
exchange
rate
mechanism
of
the
European
Monetary
System
,
and
warned
there
are
``
no
easy
answers
''
to
Britain
's
economic
problems
.

Some
market
analysts
see
early
entry
into
the
EMS
exchange
rate
mechanism
as
one
of
the
few
alternatives
left
for
stabilizing
the
pound
.

But
entry
has
been
opposed
by
Prime
Minister
Thatcher
,
who
insists
Britain
should
join
from
a
position
of
strength
.

Wednesday
's
discount
rate
increase
in
Japan
continued
to
dominate
trading
in
Tokyo
,
with
dealers
trying
to
guess
what

the
Bank
of
Japan
and
the
Fed
will
do
following
the
failure
of
the
rate
boost
to
depress
the
dollar
.

The
Bank
of
Japan
entered
the
market
several
times
in
the
morning
to
sell
dollars
for
yen
,
traders
said
.

European
dealings
were
dominated
by
cross
activity
,
highlighted
by
sterling
.

On
the
Commodity
Exchange
in
New
York
,
gold
for
current
delivery
settled
at
$
363.40

an
ounce
,
up
$
1.40
.

Estimated
volume
was
a
light
2.2
million
ounces
.

In
early
trading
in
Hong
Kong
Friday
,
gold
was
quoted
at
$
363.35

an
ounce
.

First
Federal
Savings
Bank
said
holders
voted
to
approve
its
proposed
merger
with
First
American
Federal
Savings
&
Loan
Association
,
Huntsville
,
Ala
.

The
thrift
said
it
is
waiting
for
final
regulatory
approval
of
the
transaction
,
after
which

its
holders
will
be
entitled
to
receive
$
20.83

each
share
held
.

The
Canadian
government
announced
a
new
,
12-year
Canada
Savings
Bond
issue

that
will
yield
investors
10.5
%
in
the
first
year
.

The
annual
interest
rate
for
each
of
the
next
11
years
will
be
set
each
fall
,
when
details
of
a
new
series
are
released
.

Canada
Savings
Bonds
are
major
government
instruments
for
meeting
its
financial
requirements
.

The
government
has
about
41.4
billion
Canadian
dollars
(
US$
35.2
billion
)
of
such
bonds
currently
outstanding
.

Only
Canadian
residents
are
permitted
to
buy
Canada
Savings
Bonds
,
which
may
be
redeemed
any
time
at
face
value
.

The
bonds
go
on
sale
Oct.
19
.

For
20
years
,
federal
rules
have
barred
the
three
major
television
networks
from
sharing
in
one
of
the
most
lucrative
and
fastest-growing
parts
of
the
television
business
.

And
for
six
years
,
NBC
,
ABC
and
CBS
have
negotiated
with
Hollywood
studios
in
a
futile
attempt
to
change
that
.

But
with
foreign
companies
snapping
up
U.S.
movie
studios
,
the
networks
are
pressing
their
fight
harder
than
ever
.

They
hope
the
foreign
deals
will
divide
the
Hollywood
opposition
and
prod
Congress
to
push
for
ending
federal
rules

that
prohibit
the
networks
from
grabbing
a
piece
of
rerun
sales
and
owning
part
of
the
shows
they
put
on
the
air
.

Even
network
executives
,
however
,
admit
privately
that
victory
--
either
in
Congress
or
in
talks
with
the
studios
--
is
highly
doubtful

any
time
soon
.

And
so
the
networks
also
are
pushing
for
new
ways
to
sidestep
the
``
fin-syn
''
provisions
,
known
formally
as
the
Financial
Interest
and
Syndication
Rules
.

That
became
clear
last
week
with
the
disclosure
that
National
Broadcasting
Co.
,
backed
by
the
deep
pockets
of
parent
General
Electric
Co.
,
had
tried
to
help
fund
Qintex
Australia
Ltd.
's
now-scuttled
$
1.5
billion
bid
for
Communications
Co
.

NBC
's
interest
may
revive
the
deal
,
which

killed
last
week
when
the
Australian
concern
had
trouble
raising
cash
.

Even
if
that
deal
is
n't
revived
,
NBC
hopes
to
find
another
.

``
Our
doors
are
open
,
''
an
NBC
spokesman
says
.

NBC
may
yet
find
a
way
to
take
a
passive
,
minority
interest
in
a
program-maker
without
violating
the
rules
.

And
any
NBC
effort
could
prompt
CBS
Inc.
and
ABC
's
parent
,
Capital
Inc.
,
to
look
for
ways
of
skirting
the
fin-syn
regulations
.

But
the
networks
'
push
may
only
aggravate
an
increasingly
bitter
rift
between
them
and
Hollywood
studios
.

Both

sides
are
to
sit
down
next
month
for
yet
another
meeting
on
how
they
might
agree
on
reducing
fin-syn
restraints
.

Few
people
privy
to
the
talks
expect
the
studios
to
budge
.

The
networks
still
are
``
uninhibited
in
their
authority
''
over
what
shows
get
on
the
air
,
charges
Motion
Picture
Association
President
Jack
Valenti
,
the
most
vociferous
opponent
of
rescinding
the
rules
.

Studios
are
``
powerless
''
to
get
shows
in
prime-time
lineups
and
keep
them
there
long
enough
to
go
into
lucrative
rerun
sales
,
he
contends
.

And
that
's
why
the
rules
,
for
the
most
part
,
must
stay
in
place
,
he
says
.

Studio
executives
in
on
the
talks
-
including
officials
at
Paramount
Communications
Inc.
,
Fries
Entertainment
Inc.
,
Warner
Communications
Inc.
and
MCA
Inc.
--
declined
to
be
interviewed
.

But
Mr.
Valenti
,
who
represents
the
studios
,
asserts
:
``
The
whole
production
industry
,
to
a
man
,
is
on
the
side
of
preserving
''
the
rules
.

Such
proclamations
leave
network
officials
all
the
more
doubtful
that
the
studios
will
bend
.

``
They
do
n't
seem
to
have
an
incentive
to
negotiate
,
''
says
one
network
executive
.

``
And
there
's
no
indication
that
Washington
is
prepared
to
address
the
rules
.

That
's
the
problem
,
is
n't
it
?

''

Indeed
it
is
.

Congress
has
said
repeatedly
it
wants
no
part
of
the
mess
,
urging
the
studios
and
the
networks
,
which
license
rights
to
air
shows
made
by
the
studios
,
to
work
out
their
own
compromise
.

But
recent
developments
have
made
the
networks
--
and
NBC
President
Robert
Wright
,
in
particular
--
ever
more
adamant
that
the
networks
must
be
unshackled
to
survive
.

The
latest
provocation
:
Sony
Corp.
's
plan
to
acquire
Columbia
Pictures
Entertainment
Inc.
for
$
3.4
billion
,
and
to
buy
independent
producer
Guber
Peters
Entertainment
Co.
for
$
200
million
.

``
I
wonder
what

Walter
Cronkite
will

the
Broadcast

Evening
News

Dan
Rather

,
''
wrote
J.B.
Holston
,
an
NBC
vice
president
,
in
a
commentary
in
last
week
's
issue
of
Broadcasting
magazine
.

In
his
article
,
Mr.
Holston
,
who
was
in
Europe
last
week
and
unavailable
,
complained
that
the
``
archaic
restraints
''
in
fin-syn
rules
have
``
contributed
directly
to
the
acquisition
of
the
studios
by
non-U.S.
enterprises
.

''
(
He
did
n't
mention
that
NBC
,
in
the
meantime
,
was
hoping
to
assist
Australia
's
Qintex
in
buying

An
NBC
spokesman
counters
that
Mr.
Holston
's
lament
was
``
entirely
consistent
''
with
NBC
plans
because
the
U.S.
rules
would
limit
NBC
's
involvement
in
the
Qintex
deal
so
severely
as
to
be
``
light
years
away
from
the
type
of
unrestrained
deals
available
to
Sony
--
and
everyone
else
except
the
three
networks
.

''

The
Big
Three
's
drumbeat
for
deregulation
began
intensifying
in
the
summer
when
the
former
Time
Inc.
went
ahead
with
plans
to
acquire
Warner
.

Although
Time
already
had
a
long-term
contract
to
buy
movies
from
Warner
,
the
merger
will
let
Time
's
largely
unregulated
pay-cable
channel
,
Home
Box
Office
,
own
the
Warner
movies
aired
on
HBO
--
a
vertical
integration

that
is
effectively
blocked
by
fin-syn
regulations
.

NBC
's
Mr.
Wright
led
the
way
in
decrying
the
networks
'
inability
to
match
a
Time-Warner
combination
.

He
spoke
up
again
when
the
Sony
bid
for
Columbia
was
announced
.

Since
NBC
's
interest
in
the
Qintex
bid
for
was
disclosed
,
Mr.
Wright
has
n't
been
available
for
comment
.

With
a
Qintex
deal
,
NBC
would
move
into
uncharted
territory
--
possibly
raising
hackles
at
the
studios
and
in
Washington
.

``
It
's
never
really
been
tested
,
''
says
William
Lilley
III
,
who
as
a
top
CBS
executive
spent
years
lobbying
to
have
the
rules
lifted
.

He
now
runs
Policy
Communications
in
Washington
,
consulting
to
media
companies
.

Fin-syn
rules
do
n't
explicitly
block
a
network
from
buying
a
passive
,
small
stake
in
a
company
that
profits
from
the
rerun
syndication
networks
ca
n't
enjoy
.

Hence
,
NBC
might
be
able
to
take
,
say
,
a
5
%
stake
in
a
company
such
as
.

If
the
transaction
raised
objections
,
the
studio
's
syndication
operations
could
be
spun
off
into
a
separate
firm
in
which

the
network
does
n't
have
a
direct
stake
.

But
such
convolutions
would
still
block
the
networks
from
grabbing
a
big
chunk
of
the
riches
of
syndication
.

Under
current
rules
,
even
when
a
network
fares
well
with
a
100%-owned
series
--
ABC
,
for
example
,
made
a
killing
in
broadcasting
its
popular
``
Moonlighting
''
--
it
is
n't
allowed
to
share
in
the
continuing
proceeds
when
the
reruns
are
sold
to
local
stations
.

Instead
,
ABC
will
have
to
sell
off
the
rights
for
a
one-time
fee
.

The
networks
admit
that
the
chances
of
getting
the
relief

they
want
are
slim
--
for
several
years
at
the
least
.

Six
years
ago
they
were
tantalizingly
close
.

The
Reagan-era
Federal
Communications
Commission
had
ruled
in
favor
of
killing
most
of
the
rules
.

Various
evidence
,
including
a
Brookings
Institution
study
of
some
800
series
that
the
networks
had
aired
and
had
partly
owned
in
the
1960s
,
showed
the
networks
did
n't
wield
undue
control
over
the
studios
as
had
been
alleged
.

But
just
eight
days
before
the
rules
were
to
die
,
former
President
Ronald
Reagan
,
a
one-time
actor
,
intervened
on
behalf
of
Hollywood
.

The
FCC
effort
collapsed
.

The
networks
and
studios
have
bickered
ever
since
.

Network
officials
involved
in
the
studio
talks
may
hope
the
foreign
influx
builds
more
support
in
Washington
,
but
that
seems
unlikely
.

In
Congress
,
the
issue
falters
:
It
's
about
money
,
not
program
quality
,
and
Hollywood
has
lots
of
clout
given
its
fund
raising
for
senators
and
representatives
overseeing
the
issue
.

A
spokesman
for
Rep.
Edward
J.
Markey
(
D-Mass.
)
,
who
heads
a
subcommittee

that
oversees
the
FCC
,
says
Mr.
Markey
feels
``
the
world
has
been
forever
changed
by
the
Sony-Columbia
deal
.

''
But
he
said
Mr.
Markey
hopes
this
pushes
the
networks
and
studios
to
work
it
out
on
their
own
.

And
at
the
FCC
,
meanwhile
,
new
Chairman
Alfred
C.
Sikes
has
said
he
wants
the
two
sides
to
hammer
out
their
own
plan
.

There
's
an
intense
debate
in
South
Korean
President
Roh
Tae
Woo
's
inner
circle
over
his
scheduled
speech
Wednesday
to
a
joint
meeting
of
Congress
:
Should
he
give
it
in
English
or
Korean
?

It
would
be
more
effective
with
the
U.S.
politicians
and
public
in
English
,
the
president
's
foreign
policy
advisers
argue
.

But
,
counter
some
domestic
political
aides
,
it
would
hurt
Mr.
Roh
at
home
if
he
seems
to
be
pandering
to
the
Americans
.

U.S.
politicians
and
policy-makers
would
do
well
to
remember
such
backhome
pressures
on
the
South
Korean
president
as
they
prepare
for
an
important
series
of
meetings
with
him

this
week
.

For
U.S.-South
Korean
relations
,
in
economic
and
security
terms
,
are
at
their
most
critical
stage
since
the
Korean
War
.

When
most
Americans
think
about
South
Korea
,
they
still
conjure
up
images
of
the
war
years
,
popularized
by
the
TV

But
South
Korea
no
longer
is
a
backwater
,
Third
World
country
.

With
a
dynamic
,
growing
economy
,
it
is
the
U.S.
's
seventh-largest
trading
partner
.

Moreover
,
the
Korean
peninsula
remains
one
of
the
strategic
focal
points
of
East
Asia
;
there
are
43,000
U.S.
troops
stationed
there
.

And
the
country
is
at
a
political
crossroads
now
,
as
it
struggles
with
its
new
experiment
in
democracy
.

South
Korea
is
``
critically
important
to
us
now
,
both
economically
and
in
terms
of
security
,
''
says
Sen.
Richard
Lugar
(
R.
,
Ind.
)
,
the
former
chairman
of
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
.

``
Unfortunately
,
many
Americans
do
n't
think
much
about
Korea
.

But
the
miracle
of
their
economic
growth
and
the
development
of
democracy
--
imperfect
though
it
is
--
are
very
important
to
the
United
States
.

''
One

major
topic
during
Mr.
Roh
's
visit
will
be
human
rights
.

Due
process
still
is
denied
in
South
Korea
;
a
few
months
ago
,
Kim
Dae
Jung
,
the
major
opposition
leader
,
was
detained
and
interrogated
for
20
hours
by
security
thugs
.

Just
as
Pope
John
Paul
II
did
in
Seoul
last
week
,
President
Bush
and
members
of
Congress
ought
to
tell
Mr.
Roh
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
this
kind
of
behavior
is
unacceptable
.

But
context
is
important
.

South
Korea
had
a
free
election
last
year
;
the
liberals
lost
only
because
they
could
n't
unite
behind
one
candidate
.

Moreover
,
there
is
a
violent
anti-U.S.
minority
in
South
Korea
--
as
demonstrated
by
the
handful
of
radical
students

who
broke
into
U.S.
Ambassador
Donald
Gregg
's
residence
in
Seoul
Friday
and
vandalized
it
(
the
ambassador
and
his
wife
were
unharmed
)
.

Mr.
Roh
,
a
former
general
and
a
member
of
the
repressive
previous
regime
,
has
made
impressive
strides
in
supporting
democratic
values
and
institutions
.

It
is
n't
a
perfect
democracy
,
but
it
's
a
far
cry
from
the
authoritarian
rule
of
only
a
few
years
ago
.

One
thing

that
has
n't
changed
in
South
Korea
is
paranoia
about
North
Korea
;
several
people
are
being
prosecuted
for
making
unapproved
visits
to
the
communist
north
.

But
a
visit
to
Panmunjom
,
where
the
constant
tension
between
the
communists
and
the
joint
U.S.-South
Korean
forces
is
palpable
,
makes
it
easier
to
understand
these
feelings
.

Sometimes
U.S.
politicians
forget
that
North
Korea
,
a
country
with
a
population
of
only
20
million
,
has
an
armed
force
of
over
one
million
troops
,
the
sixth
largest
in
the
world
.

Whatever
winds
of
change
are
blowing
through
much
of
the
communist
bloc
,
they
have
n't
reached
Pyongyang
.

As
long
as
it
continues
to
pose
a
real
threat
,
U.S.
critics
ought
to
go
slow
on
demands
to
reduce
troop
levels
in
South
Korea
.

The
major
topic
when
Mr.
Roh
calls
on
administration
and
congressional
figures

this
week
will
be
economics
and
trade
.

South
Korea
hardly
is
without
fault
for
trade
frictions
with
the
U.S.
;
most
experts
in
the
administration
think
that
Commerce
Secretary
Robert
Mosbacher
got
it
exactly
wrong
a
few
months
ago
when
he
declared
that
South
Korea
is
more
open
economically
than
Japan
.

On
agricultural
products
in
particular
--
everything
from
beef
to
apples
--
the
Koreans
have
succumbed
to
domestic
political
pressures
for
protectionism
.

Yet
,
earlier
this
year
,
South
Korea
promised
to
make
some
real
concessions
on
its
investment
laws
and
other
trade
impediments
.

They
enabled
the
country
to
avoid
being
targeted
as
an
unfair
trade
partner
under
the
tough
``
Super
301
''
section
of
the
1988
U.S.
trade
act
.

Separately
,
as
a
result
of
the
revaluation
of
the
won
and
other
measures
,
the
almost
$
10
billion
trade
surplus

the
South
Koreans
enjoyed
with
the
U.S
last
year
will
be
cut
in
half
this
year
.

Moreover
,
just
a
few
days
ago
,
the
national
assembly
,
with
the
governing
and
opposition
parties
in
an
unusual
alliance
,
passed
a
resolution
calling
for
a
gradual
opening
up
of
South
Korean
agricultural
markets
.

It
's
appropriate
for
U.S.
officials
to
keep
hammering
for
more
open
trade
policies
,
as
U.S.
Trade
Representative
Carla
Hills
did
in
Seoul
last
week
.

But
there
's
also
sometimes
a
tendency
in
American
political
circles
to
pick
especially
on
South
Korea
,
out
of
frustration
over
our
inability
to
do
much
about
Japan
.

That
's
counterproductive
.

Most
importantly
,
it
's
time
for
American
policy-makers
to
better
appreciate
that
our
economic
future
rests
more
with
Asia
--
Seoul
as
well
as
Tokyo
--
than
anyplace
else
.

The
U.S.
always
ought
to
stand
up
for
its
interests
,
but
it
's
essential
that
U.S.
officials
have
an
appreciation
of
the
politics
and
history
of
our
allies
.

In
the
upper
echelons
of
the
Roh
Tae
Woo
's
government
,
they
're
still
buzzing
about
Commerce
Secretary
Mosbacher
's
trip
to
South
Korea
earlier
this
year
.

It
seems
he
learned
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
South
Korea
had
been
occupied
for
decades
by
Japan
.

Dismal
sales
at
General
Motors
Corp.
dragged
the
U.S.
car
and
truck
market
down
below
year-ago
levels
in
early
October
,
the
first
sales
period
of
the
1990
model
year
.

The
eight
major
domestic
auto
makers
sold
160,510
North
American-made
cars
in
the
first
10
days
of
October
,
a
12.6
%
drop
from
a
year
earlier
.

Domestically
built
truck
sales
were
down
10.4
%
to
86,555
pickups
,
vans
and
sport
utility
vehicles
.

The
heavy
use
of
incentives
to
clear
out
1989
models
appears
to
have
taken
the
steam
,
at
least
initially
,
out
of
1990
model
sales
,
which
began
officially
Oct.
1
.

This
appears
particularly
true
at
GM
,
which
had
strong
sales
in
August
and
September
but
saw
its
early
October
car
and
truck
results
fall
26.3
%
from
last
year
's
unusually
high
level
.

Overall
,
sales
of
all
domestic-made
vehicles
fell
11.9
%
from
a
year
ago
.

Without
GM
,
overall
sales
for
the
other
U.S.
automakers
were
roughly
flat
with
1989
results
.

Some
of
the
U.S.
auto
makers
have
already
adopted
incentives
on
many
1990
models
,
but
they
may
have
to
broaden
their
programs
to
keep
sales
up
.

``
We
've
created
a
condition
where
,
without
incentives
,
it
's
a
tough
market
,
''
said
Tom
Kelly
,
sales
manager
for
Bill
Wink
Chevrolet
in
Dearborn
,
Mich
.

Car
sales
fell
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
annual
selling
rate
of
5.8
million
vehicles
,
the
lowest
since
October
1987
.

The
poor
performance
contrasts
with
a
robust
selling
rate
of
almost
eight
million
last
month
.

Furthermore
,
dealers
contacted
late
last
week
said
they
could
n't
see
any
immediate
impact
on
sales
of
Friday
's
steep
market
decline
.

GM
's
domestic
car
sales
dropped
24.3
%
and
its
domestic
trucks
were
down
an
even
steeper
28.7
%
from
the
same
period

a
year
ago
.

All
of
the
GM
divisions
except
Cadillac
showed
big
declines
.

Cadillac
posted
a
3.2
%
increase
despite
new
competition
from
Lexus
,
the
fledging
luxury-car
division
of
Toyota
Motor
Corp
.

Lexus
sales
were
n't
available
;
the
cars
are
imported
and
Toyota
reports
their
sales
only
at
month-end
.

The
sales
drop
for
the
No.
1
car
maker
may
have
been
caused
in
part
by
the
end
in
September
of
dealer
incentives
that
GM
offered
in
addition
to
consumer
rebates
and
low-interest
financing
,
a
company
spokesman
said
.

Last
year
,
GM
had
a
different
program
in
place

that
continued
rewarding
dealers
until
all
the
1989
models
had
been
sold
.

Aside
from
GM
,
other
car
makers
posted
generally
mixed
results
.

Ford
Motor
Co.
had
a
1.8
%
drop
in
domestic
car
sales
but
a
2.4
%
increase
in
domestic
truck
sales
.

Chrysler
Corp.
had
a
7.5
%
drop
in
car
sales
,
echoing
its
generally
slow
performance

all
year
.

However
,
sales
of
trucks
,
including
the
company
's
popular
minivans
,
rose
4.3
%
.

Honda
Motor
Co.
's
sales
of
domestically
built
vehicles
plunged
21.7
%
from
a
year
earlier
.

Honda
's
plant
in
Marysville
,
Ohio
,
was
gearing
up
to
build
1990
model
Accords
,
a
Honda
spokesman
said
.

``
We
're
really
confident

everything
will
bounce
back
to
normal
,
''
he
added
.

Separately
,
Chrysler
said
firm
prices
on
its
1990-model
domestic
cars
and
minivans
will
rise
an
average
of
5
%
over
comparably
equipped
1989
models
.

Firm
prices
were
generally
in
line
with
the
tentative
prices
announced
earlier
this
fall
.

At
that
time
,
Chrysler
said
base
prices
,
which
are
n't
adjusted
for
equipment
changes
,
would
rise
between
4
%
and
9
%
on
most
vehicle
.

The
tug
of
war
between
Warner
Communications
Inc.
and
Sony
Corp.
over
movie
producers
Peter
Guber
and
Jon
Peters
has
exploded
into
a
legal
battle

that
could
prove
an
embarrassing
setback
to
Sony
's
plans
to
enter
the
U.S.
movie
business
.

On
Friday
,
after
two
weeks
of
fruitless
settlement
talks
,
Warner
filed
suit
in
Los
Angeles
Superior
Court
against
Sony
and
Guber
Peters
Entertainment
Co.
,
charging
Sony
with
inducing
the
two
producers
to
breach
a
five-year
contract
with
Warner
.

The
suit
seeks
$
1
billion
in
damages
and
an
injunction
barring
Messrs.
Guber
and
Peters
from
taking
the
top
management
posts
at
Columbia
Pictures
Entertainment
Inc
.

As
previously
reported
,
Sony
has
agreed
to
pay
$
3.4
billion
to
acquire
Columbia
and
separately
has
agreed
to
pay
$
200
million
for
Guber
Peters
Entertainment
to
obtain
the
services
of
its
two
co-chief
executives
.

Sony
and
Guber
Peters
promptly
countersued
,
charging
Warner
with
attempting
to
interfere
in
Sony
's
acquisition
of
the
two
companies
and
with
falsely
asserting
that
the
Guber
Peters
agreement
with
Warner
prevents
them
from
accepting
the
senior
management
posts
at
Columbia
.

At
issue
in
the
lawsuits
is
the
contract
signed
last
March
by
Messrs.
Guber
and
Peters

that
requires
the
two
to
make
movies
exclusively
for
Warner
for
the
next
five
years
.

Sony
and
Messrs.
Guber
and
Peters
maintain
that
the
contract
does
n't
prohibit
taking
an
executive
post
at
another
studio
.

Moreover
,
they
assert
,
the
producers
have
an
oral
agreeement
with
Warner
Bros.
studio
executives

that
gives
them

the
right
to
``
terminate
the
producer
relationship
in
the
event

they
were
given
and
chose
to
accept
the
opportunity
to
become
senior
executives
of
a
motion
picture
studio
,
''
according
to
their
countersuit
.

Warner
,
for
its
part
,
maintains
that
the
written
agreement
prevents
Messrs.
Guber
and
Peters
from
doing
anything
else
in
the
motion
picture
business
.

Warner
says
in
its
suit
that
Sony
``
has
unethically
and
illegally
sought
to
steal
the
services
of
Guber
and
Peters
and
injure
Warner
as
a
major
competitor
of
Columbia
.

''
Moreover
,
Warner
says
,
Sony
enticed
the
producers
with
``
unprecedented
financial
rewards
to
breach
their
binding
contractual
commitments
to
Warner
.

''
Warner
also
names
in
its
suit

the
two
producers
,
Sony
Corp.
of
America
Vice
Chairman
Michael
Schulof
,
and
Walter
Yetnikoff
,
head
of
Sony
's
CBS
Records
unit
.

Sony
responded
in
its
countersuit
by
charging
Warner
,
its
chief
executive
Steven
J.
Ross
,
and
Warner
Bros.
unit
chairman
Robert
Daly
and
President
Terry
Semel
with
embarking
on
an
unlawful
scheme
to
interfere
with
and
disrupt
Sony
's
acquisitions
.

Warner
,
which
is
in
the
process
of
being
acquired
by
Time
Warner
Inc.
,
is
attempting
to
``
sabotage
''
Sony
's
efforts
as
part
of
a
``
plan
and
scheme
to
dominate
and
control
the
entertainment
business
,
''
the
countersuit
from
Sony
and
Guber
Peters
adds
.

Warner
also
appears
to
be
trying
to
embarrass
Sony
by
accusing
the
Japanese
company
's
U.S
executives
,
Messrs.
Schulof
and
Yetnikoff
,
of
dishonorable
dealings
.

In
its
suit
,
Warner
says
that
Mr.
Ross
warned
Sony
's
Mr.
Schulof
on
Sept.
26
at
a
dinner
in
Washington
,
``
with
Guber
Peters
in
mind
''
that
in
the
U.S.
``
it
is
essential
that
corporations
honor
written
contracts
and
do
not
induce
breach
of
contracts
by
others
.

''
Sony
went
ahead
the
next
day
anyway
and
executed
its
own
five-year
agreement
with
the
producers
and
agreed
to
buy
their
company
,
the
suit
adds
.

Moreover
,
the
suit
adds
that
Sony
initially
said
it
would
n't
buy
Guber
Peters
unless
the
Warner
contract
was
settled
.

On
Tuesday
,
although
a
settlement
was
n't
reached
,
Sony
publicly
announced
it
would
acquire
Guber
Peters
.

``
Sony
has
thus
knowingly
and
willfully
,
and
over
Warner
's
protests
,
induced
Guber
and
Peters
to
repudiate
their
contract
with
Warner
,
''
the
suit
says
.

Warner
's
decision
to
file
suit
in
the
wake
of
its
failure
to
reach
a
settlement
with
Sony
did
n't
surprise
executives
at
rival
studios
,
who
say
Warner
is
only
protecting
its
own
interests
.

The
outcome
of
the
legal
battle
,
they
add
,
could
redefine
contractual
relationships
in
Hollywood
,
where
the
unwritten
rule
has
often
been
that
contracts
were
made
to
be
broken
.

In
Warner
's
case
,
the
studio
obviously
regards
the
relationship
with
Guber
Peters
as
a
crucial
factor
in
Warner
's
recent
success
and
a
central
part
of
its
future
plans
.

Warner
has
relied
heavily
on
the
two
to
find
and
produce
movies
for
the
studio
,
including
this
summer
's
hit
``
Batman
.

''
Warner
says
in
its
suit
that
``
Guber
and
Peters
claim
to
have
generated
over
one-half
billion
dollars
in
profits
for
Warner
from
combined
projects
,
''
a
claim
Warner
does
n't
dispute
.

And
Warner
says
it
is
currently
financing
about
50
new
projects
being
developed
by
the
two
producers
.

Under
an
earlier
agreement
with
Warner
,
the
producers
were
allowed
to
make
movies
elsewhere
.

For
example
,
they
made
the
hit
``
Rainman
''
for
Communications
Co
.

But
when
Warner
signed
a
new
agreement
with
the
two
in
March
,
the
terms
specifically
prohibited
them
from
serving
as
producers
or
executive
producers
of
movies
for
any
other
studio
.

Sony
and
the
Guber
Peters
executives
say
in
their
countersuit
,
however
,
that
the
new
contract
eliminated
language
barring
the
two
from
serving
``
in
any
other
capacity
''
in
the
motion
picture
business
.

And
they
appear
to
be
relying
heavily
on
an
alleged
``
oral
agreement
''
the
two
producers
claim
to
have
with
Warner

that
would
let
them
out
of
their
written
contract
in
the
event
that
an
actual
executive
post
at
another
company
became
available
.

In
their
countersuit
,
they
say
that
on
two
previous
occasions
--
once
in
1987
when
they
considered
a
post
at
Columbia
,
and
once
when
Messrs.
Guber
and
Peters
tried
to
buy
a
stake
in
in
1988
--
Warner
was
prepared
to
release
them
from
their
contract
.

The
countersuit
also
charges
Warner
with
making
the
oral
agreement
to
``
falsely
induce
''
them
into
a
new
written
contract
in
1989
.

Moreover
,
they
say
,
Warner
is
trying
to
cheat
them
out
of
``
a
unique
business
opportunity
''
and
the
fulfilment
of
their
``
long-term
dream
''
to
run
their
own
studio
.

But
entertainment
industry
executives
say
that
the
new
contract
was
signed
after
Guber
Peters
efforts
to
take
over
MGM
failed
and
that
Warner
may
argue
in
court
that
the
producers
'
willingness
to
sign
a
new
long-term
contract
signaled
the
end
of
their
search
for
a
movie
studio
.

Mr.
Ross
and
his
team
at
Warner
appear
to
view
the
move
by
the
two
producers
to
Sony
as
a
personal
betrayal
after
years
of
support
and
friendship
.

``
Warner
has
been
nurturing
its
relationship
with
Guber
and
Peters
since
1972
,
long
before
their
recent
success
,
''
the
Warner
suit
says
.

That
success
,
the
suit
adds
,
``
is
due
in
large
measure
to
the
trust
and
confidence
that
Warner
has
reposed
in
these
producers
,
even
in
the
early
years
of
the
relationship
when
the
creative
partnership
was
not
particularly
profitable
for
Warner
.

''

Warner
,
whose
executives
are
the
highest
paid
in
the
entertainment
industry
,
also
charges
that
Sony
induced
the
two
producers
to
breach
their
Warner
contract
by
offering
them
``
the
most
lucrative
and
expensive
package
of
financial
inducements
in
the
film
industry
,
''
including
$
2.7
million
each
in
annual
salary
,
deferred
compensation
of
$
50
million
,
as
much
as
10
%
of
Columbia
's
cash
flow
,
and
as
much
as
8
%
of
the
future
appreciation
of
Columbia
's
market
value
.

The
producers
also
stand
to
get
more
than
$
50
million
from
their
combined
28
%
stake
in
Guber
Peters
Entertainment
from
Sony
's
$
200
million
offer
for
the
company
.

In
their
countersuit
,
Messrs.
Guber
and
Peters
say
they
seek
$
100
million
in
damages
initially
from
Warner
but
may
seek
a
higher
amount
later
after
determining
the
extent
of
damages
.

Troubled
British
defense
contractor
Ferranti
International
Signal
PLC
replaced
the
head
of
its
scandal-plagued
U.S.
division
.

Ferranti
said
Joseph
Zilligen
,
49
years
old
,
chairman
of
Ferranti
International
USA
,
is
``
relinquishing
''
his
post
.

Succeeding
him
as
chairman
of
the
large
,
Lancaster
,
Pa.-based
unit
,
is
a
longtime
Ferranti
executive
,
Albert
Dodd
.

Mr.
Dodd
,
a
53-year-old
Briton
,
is
a
Ferranti
board
member
and
managing
director
of
Ferranti
's
instrumentation
division
.

The
U.S.
unit
is
at
the
center
of
what

Ferranti
has
called
a
``
serious
fraud
''
that
has
rocked
the
British
company
for
the
past
month
.

Ferranti
acquired
the
U.S.
business
last
year
,
in
a
merger
with
the
then
International
Signal
&
Control
Group

An
International
Signal
unit
,
according
to
Ferranti
,
reported
on
its
books
#
215
million
(
$
332.5
million
)
of
weapons
contracts

that
did
n't
exist
.

The
falsified
figures
inflated
International
Signal
's
reported
assets
,
and
increased
the
price
Ferranti
paid
when
it
bought
the
company
,
according
to
Ferranti
officials
.

Mr.
Zilligen
's
departure
is
the
latest
fallout
from
the
scandal
.

Ferranti
has
said
it
expects
an
accounting
correction

that
would
eliminate
nearly
half
its
reported
net
worth
,
and
it
's
seeking
a
buyer
to
repair
its
finances
.

British
Aerospace
PLC
and
France
's
Thomson-CSF
S.A.
are
leading
contenders
for
a
joint
Ferranti
bid
.

Yesterday
,
a
London
brokerage
firm
,
Hoare
Govett
Ltd.
,
confirmed
that
it
purchased
on
Wednesday
5.7
million
Ferranti
shares
at
56
pence
(
87
cents
)
apiece
on
behalf
of
British
Aerospace
.

The
purchase
boosts
the
British
Aerospace-Thomson
stake
to
12.98
million
shares
,
or
1.7
%
of
the
stock
outstanding
.

A
Ferranti
spokesman
declined
to
comment
on
whether
the
management
shuffle
is
related
to
the
financial
scandal
,
but
called
it
generally
part
of
the
``
integration
''
of
International
Signal
into
Ferranti
since
the
1988
merger
.

He
said
Mr.
Zilligen
remains
a
Ferranti
director
,
but
will
also
be
succeeded
by
Mr.
Dodd
as
chief
executive
of
Ferranti
Italia
.

Mr.
Zilligen
,
through
a
spokesman
in
Lancaster
,
declined
to
comment
.

The
executive
was
a
colleague
since
1980
of
International
Signal
founder
James
Guerin
,
who
left
International
Signal
and
Ferranti
last
spring
.

U.S.
OFFICIALS
MOVED
to
head
off
any
repeat
of
Black
Monday
today
following
Friday
's
plunge
in
stock
prices
.

Fed
Chairman
Greenspan
signaled
that
the
central
bank
was
prepared
to
inject
massive
amounts
of
money
into
the
banking
system
to
prevent
a
financial
crisis
.

Other
U.S.
and
foreign
officials
also
mapped
out
plans
,
though
they
kept
their
moves
quiet
to
avoid
making
the
financial
markets
more
jittery
.

Friday
's
sell-off
was
triggered
by
the
collapse
of
UAL
's
buy-out
plan
and
a
big
rise
in
producer
prices
.

The
Dow
Jones
industrials
skidded
190.58
,
to
2569.26
.

The
junk
bond
market
came
to
a
standstill
,
while
Treasury
bonds
soared
and
the
dollar
fell
.

Japanese
stocks
dropped
early
Monday
,
but
by
late
morning
were
turning
around
.

The
dollar
was
trading
sharply
lower
in
Tokyo
.

Prospects
for
a
new
UAL
buy-out
proposal
appear
bleak
.

Many
banks
refused
to
back
the
$
6.79
billion
transaction
,
but
bankers
said
it
was
not
from
any
unwillingness
to
finance
takeovers
.

The
decision
was
based
solely
on
problems
with
the
UAL
management-pilot
plan
,
they
said
.

The
surge
in
producer
prices
in
September
followed
three
months
of
declines
,
but
analysts
were
divided
on
whether
the
0.9
%
jump
signaled
a
severe
worsening
of
inflation
.

Also
,
retail
sales
grew
0.5
%
last
month
.

A
capital-gains
tax
cut
was
removed
from
the
Senate
's
deficit
reduction
bill
,
but
proponents
still
hope
to
enact
the
cut

this
year
.

Bush
wo
n't
press
for
a
capital-gains
provision
in
the
final
deficit
bill
when
House-Senate
conferees
meet
later
this
week
.

General
Motors
signaled
that
up
to
five
North
American
assembly
plants
may
close
by
the
mid-1990s
as
it
tries
to
cut
excess
capacity
.

U.S.
car
and
truck
sales
fell
12.6
%
in
early
October
,
the
first
sales
period
of
the
1990-model
year
,
dragged
down
by
a
sharp
decline
in
GM
sales
.

Warner
and
Sony
are
entangled
in
a
legal
battle
over
movie
producers
Peter
Gruber
and
Jon
Peters
.

The
fight
could
set
back
Sony
's
plans
to
enter
the
U.S.
movie
business
.

Hooker
's
U.S.
unit
received
a
$
409
million
bid
for
most
of
its
real-estate
and
shopping-center
assets
from
an
investor
group
.

The
offer
does
n't
include
Bonwit
Teller
or
B.
Altman
.

The
Boeing
strike
is
starting
to
affect
airlines
.

America
West
said
Friday

it
will
postpone
its
new
service
out
of
Houston
because
of
delays
in
receiving
aircraft
from
Boeing
.

Saatchi
&
Saatchi
would
launch
a
management
buy-out
if
a
hostile
suitor
emerged
,
an
official
said
.

British
Aerospace
and
France
's
Thomson-CSF
are
nearing
a
pact
to
merge
guided-missile
divisions
.

New
U.S.
steel-import
quotas
will
give
a
bigger
share
to
developing
nations

that
have
relatively
unsubsidized
steel
industries
.

Japan
's
steel
quota
will
be
cut
significantly
.

Four

I
was
profoundly
moved
by
the
incongruity
of
modern
American
life
illustrated
by
your
Sept.
20
page-one
article
``
Country
Doctor
:
How
a
Physician
Solved
Riddle
of
Rare
Disease
in
Children
of
Amish
.

''

Here
is
a
young
man

who
honestly
understands
what
being
a
physician
means
and
what

it
requires
.

It
requires
delivering
quality
medical
care
to
those
in
need
.

It
requires
doing
the
utmost
within
oneself
to
alleviate
the
illness
and
suffering
of
others
.

The
physician
providing
such
care
derives
his
reward
from
being
fulfilled
as
a
provider
,
and
from
realistic
charges
for
his
care
.

Though
Holmes
Morton
fulfills
the
``
requirements
''
for
being
a
true
physician
,
our
so-called
sophisticated
society
and
its
medical
system
fail
to
appreciate
the
value
of
such
a
dedicated
physician
.

Otherwise
,
why
is
there
not
a
rush
of
funds
from
medical
circles
or
the
related
medical-support
industry
--
i.e.
pharmaceutical
companies
,
etc.
--
or
,
most
significantly
,
from
all
of
us
to
support
this
doctor
and
his
patients
,
to
support
a
clinic
to
further
the
work
of
resolving
human
suffering
?

Ted
Ferrier
Jr
.

Dallas

Having
grown
up
among
the
Amish
in
Iowa
,
I
think
I
can
appreciate
more
than
most
the
difficulty
of
Dr.
Morton
's
work
.

The
average
person
can
hardly
imagine
the
suspicion
,
bred
by
centuries
of
isolation
and
persecution
,
among
the
Amish
toward
outsiders
and
things
modern
.

This
,
in
my
experience
,
is
particularly
true
of
their
attitude
toward
modern
medicine
.

Dr.
Morton
's
success
is
not
only
a
measure
of
the
outstanding
quality
of
his
work
,
but
also
of
the
desperation

the
Amish
must
feel
in
the
face
of
this
horrendous
disease
.

Sadly
,
the
article
also
contains
a
profound
statement
about
the
current
state
of
academe
,
the
professions
in
particular
and
American
society
in
general
.

Some
experts
were
quoted
as
speculating
on
the
detrimental
effects
of
Dr.
Morton
's
work
on
his
career
.

According
to
these
experts
,
he
will
find
it
difficult
to
get
grants
and
will
lose
access
to
sophisticated
laboratories
.

They
point
out
that
he
``
will
be
,
at
best
,
on
the
very
outer
circle
.

''
As
a
marginal
academic

myself
,
I
thought
we
were
at
least
discreet
enough
to
keep
our
real
concerns
hidden
behind
our
academic
robes
and
in
our
faculty
cliques
.

We
can
only
hope
that
more
people
will
choose
to
be
``
on
the
very
outer
circle
.

How
very
refreshing
to
read
about
Dr.
Morton
after
all
the
articles
about
the
Boeskys
,
Millkens
,
Icahns
,
Trumps
and
such
like
;
about
S&L
officials
and
self-seeking
officials
and
legislators
,
federal
and
state
;
about
corporate
executives
whose
sole
concern
is
the
``
bottom
line
,
''
all
of
which
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
as
a
society

we
have
a
woeful
sense
of
values
and
give
no
thought
to
what
``
life
is
all
about
.

''
Here
is
an
individual
to
be
greatly
admired
and
respected
.

Sandro

Du
Pont
Co.
said
its
Du
Pont
do
Brasil
subsidiary
will
invest
about
$
19
million
to
build
a
multimillion-pound-per-year
fluoropolymers
plant
and
technical
center
in
Sao
Paulo
,
Brazil
.

The
plant
,
scheduled
to
operate
in
early
1992
,
is
part
of
Du
Pont
's
plan
to
increase
world-wide
fluoropolymer
capacity
40
%
by
1992
.

Du
Pont
markets
fluoropolymers
under
the
trademark
Teflon

GREAT
AMERICAN
COMMUNICATIONS
Co.
,
Cincinnati
,
said
it
exchanged
about
$
50
million
in
debentures
and
notes
for
3.65
million
of
its
common
shares
at
$
12

a
share
.

As
a
result
of
the
transaction
,
American
Financial
Corp.
's
common
holdings
in
Great
American
declined
to
64
%
from
71
%
.

The
broadcasting
concern
said
the
debt
retired
consisted
of
$
35
million
of
14
%
senior
subordinated
debentures
,
$
14.2
million
of
13
%
senior
notes
and
$
200,000
of
14
%
senior
notes
of
a
subsidiary
.

American
Financial
is
a
financial
holding
company
.

Of
all
the
one-time
expenses
incurred
by
a
corporation
or
professional
firm
,
few
are
larger
or
longer
term
than
the
purchase
of
real
estate
or
the
signing
of
a
commercial
lease
.

To
take
full
advantage
of
the
financial
opportunities
in
this
commitment
,
however
,
the
corporation
or
professional
firm
must
do
more
than
negotiate
the
best
purchase
price
or
lease
terms
.

It
must
also
evaluate
the
real-estate
market
in
the
chosen
location
from
a
new
perspective
.

Specifically
,
it
must
understand
how
real-estate
markets
overreact
to
shifts
in
regional
economies
and
then
take
advantage
of
these
opportunities
.

When
a
regional
economy
catches
cold
,
the
local
real-estate
market
gets
pneumonia
.

In
other
words
,
real-estate
market
indicators
,
such
as
building
permits
and
leasing
activity
,
plummet
much
further
than
a
local
economy
in
recession
.

This
was
seen
in
the
late
1960s
in
Los
Angeles
and
the
mid-1970s
in
New
York
.

But
the
reverse
is
also
true
:
When
a
region
's
economy
rebounds
from
a
slowdown
,
these
real-estate
indicators
will
rebound
far
faster
than
the
improving
economy
.

Why
do
local
real-estate
markets
overreact
to
regional
economic
cycles
?

Because
real-estate
purchases
and
leases
are
such
major
long-term
commitments
that
most
companies
and
individuals
make
these
decisions
only
when
confident
of
future
economic
stability
and
growth
.

Metropolitan
Detroit
was
written
off
economically
during
the
early
1980s
,
as
the
domestic
auto
industry
suffered
a
serious
sales
depression
and
adjustment
.

Area
employment
dropped
by
13
%
from
its
1979
peak
and
retail
sales
were
down
14
%
.

However
,
the
real-estate
market
was
hurt
even
more
.

For
example
,
residential
building
permits
in
the
trough
year
of
1982
were
off
76
%
from
the
1979
peak
level
.

Once
metropolitan
Detroit
's
economy
rallied
in
the
mid-1980s
,
real
estate
rebounded
.

Building
permits
,
for
example
,
soared
a
staggering
400
%
between
1982
and
the
peak
year
of
1986
.

Where
,
savvy
corporations
and
professional
firms
are
now
asking
,
are
today
's
opportunities
?

Look
no
further
than
metropolitan
Houston
and
Denver
,
two
of
the
most
depressed
,
overbuilt
and
potentially
undervalued
real-estate
markets
in
the
nation
.

Of
course
,
some
observers
have
touted
Houston
and
Denver
for
the
past
five
years
as
a
counter-cyclical
play
.

But
now
appears
to
be
the
time
to
act
.

Metropolitan
Houston
's
economy
did
drop
and
then
flatten
in
the
years
after
its
1982
peak
.

In
the
mid-1980s
,
employment
was
down
as
much
as
5
%
from
the
1982
peak
and
retail
sales
were
off
13
%
.

The
real-estate
market
suffered
even
more
severe
setbacks
.

Office
construction
dropped
97
%
.

The
vacancy
rate
soared
more
than
20
%
in
nearly
every
product
category
,
and
more
than
30
%
of
office
space
was
vacant
.

To
some
observers
,
the
empty
office
buildings
of
Houston
's
``
see-through
skyline
''
were
indicative
of
a
very
troubled
economy
.

As
usual
,
the
real-estate
market
had
overreacted
.

Actually
,
the
region
's
economy
retained
a
firm
foundation
.

Metropolitan
Houston
's
population
has
held
steady
over
the
past
six
years
.

And
personal
income
,
after
slumping
in
the
mid-1980s
,
has
returned
to
its
1982
level
in
real
dollar
terms
.

Today
,
metropolitan
Houston
's
real-estate
market
is
poised
for
a
significant
turnaround
.

More
than
42,000
jobs
were
added
in
metro
Houston
last
year
,
primarily
in
biotechnology
,
petrochemical
processing
,
and
the
computer
industry
.

This
growth
puts
Houston
in
the
top
five
metro
areas
in
the
nation
last
year
.

And
forecasts
project
a
2.5
%
to
3
%
growth
rate
in
jobs
over
the
next
few
years
--
nearly
twice
the
national
average
.

Denver
is
another
metropolitan
area
where
the
commercial
real-estate
market
has
overreacted
to
the
region
's
economic
trends
,
although
Denver
has
not
experienced
as
severe
an
economic
downturn
as
Houston
.

By
some
measures
,
metropolitan
Denver
's
economy
has
actually
improved
in
the
past
four
years
.

Its
population
has
continued
to
increase
since
1983
,
the
peak
year
of
the
economic
cycle
.

Employment
is
now
4
%
higher
than
in
1983
.

Buying
income
in
real
dollars
actually
increased
15
%
between
1983
and
1987
(
the
most
recent
year
available
)
.

The
rates
of
increase
,
however
,
are
less
than
the
rapid
growth
of
the
boom
years
,
and
this
has
resulted
in
a
loss
of
confidence
in
the
economy
.

In
a
self-fulfilling
prophecy
,
therefore
,
the
region
's
real-estate
market

all
but
collapsed
in
recent
years
.

Housing
building
permits
are
down
more
than
75
%
from
their
1983
peaks
.

Although
no
one
can
predict
when
metropolitan
Denver
's
real-estate
market
will
rebound
,
major
public
works
projects
costing
several
billion
dollars
are
under
way
or
planned
--
such
as
a
new
convention
center
,
a
major
beltway
encircling
the
metropolitan
area
,
and
a
new
regional
airport
.

When
Denver
's
regional
economy
begins
to
grow
faster
--
such
a
recovery
could
occur
as
early
as
next
year
--
business
and
consumer
confidence
will
return
,
and
the
resulting
explosion
of
real-estate
activity
will
dwarf
the
general
economic
rebound
.

What

real-estate
strategy
should
one
follow
in
a
metropolitan
area

whose
economic
health
is
not
as
easy
to
determine
as
Houston
's
or
Denver
's
?

Generally
,
overcapacity
in
commercial
real
estate
is
dropping
from
its
mid-1980s
peak
,
even
in
such
economically
healthy
metropolitan
areas
as
Washington
,
New
York
and
Los
Angeles
.

Vacancy
rates
in
the
15
%
to
19
%
range
today
may
easily
rise
to
the
low
to
mid-20
%
range
in
a
couple
of
years
.

Under
these
conditions
,
even
a
flattening
out
of
economic
growth
--
``
catching
cold
''
--
in
the
healthy
metropolitan
areas
will
create
significant
opportunities
for
corporations
and
professional
service
firms
looking
for
bargains
as
the
realestate
industry
catches
pneumonia
.

Those
looking
for
real-estate
bargains
in
distressed
metropolitan
areas
should
lock
in
leases
or
buy
now
;
those
looking
in
healthy
metropolitan
areas
should
take
a
short-term
(
three-year
)
lease
and
wait
for
the
bargains
ahead
.

Mr.
Leinberger
is
managing
partner
of
a
real-estate
advisory
firm
based
in
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif
.

Walter
Sisulu
and
the
African
National
Congress
came
home
yesterday
.

After
26
years
in
prison
,
Mr.
Sisulu
,
the
77-year-old
former
secretary-general
of
the
liberation
movement
,
was
dropped
off
at
his
house
by
a
prison
services
'
van
just
as
the
sun
was
coming
up
.

At
the
same
time
,
six
ANC
colleagues
,
five
of
whom
were
arrested
with
him
in
1963
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
,
were
reunited
with
their
families
at
various
places
around
the
country
.

And
as
the
graying
men
returned
to
their
homes
,
the
ANC
,
outlawed
in
South
Africa
since
1960
and
still
considered
to
be
the
chief
public
enemy
by
the
white
government
,
defiantly
returned
to
the
streets
of
the
country
's
black
townships
.

A
huge
ANC
flag
,
with
black
,
green
and
gold
stripes
,
was
hoisted
over
the
rickety
gate
at
Mr.
Sisulu
's
modest
house
,
while
on
the
street
out
front
,
boys
displayed
the
ANC
colors
on
their
shirts
,
caps
and
scarves
.

At
the
small
four-room
home
of
Elias
Motsoaledi
,
a
leading
ANC
unionist
and
a
former
commander
in
the
group
's
armed
wing
,
Umkhonto

we
Sizwe
,
well-wishers
stuck
little
ANC
flags
in
their
hair
and
a
man
tooted
on
an
antelope
horn
wrapped
in
ANC
ribbons
.

``
I
am
happy
to
see
the
spirit
of
the
people
,
''
said
Mr.
Sisulu
,
looking
dapper
in
a
new
gray
suit
.

As
the
crowd
outside
his
home
shouted
``
ANC
,
ANC
,
''
the
old
man
shot
his
fists
into
the
air
.

``
I
'm
inspired
by
the
mood
of
the
people
.

''

Under
the
laws
of
the
land
,
the
ANC
remains
an
illegal
organization
,
and
its
headquarters
are
still
in
Lusaka
,
Zambia
.

But
the
unconditional
release
of
the
seven
leaders
,
who
once
formed
the
intellectual
and
organizational
core
of
the
ANC
,
is
a
de
facto
unbanning
of
the
movement
and
the
rebirth
of
its
internal
wing
.

``
The
government
can
never
put
the
ANC
back
into
the
bottle
again
,
''
said
Cassim
Saloojee
,
a
veteran
anti-apartheid
activist
on
hand
to
welcome
Mr.
Sisulu
.

``
Things
have
gone
too
far
for
the
government
to
stop
them
now
.

There
's
no
turning
back
.

''

There
was
certainly
no
stopping
the
tide
of
ANC
emotion
last
night
,
when
hundreds
of
people
jammed
into
the
Holy
Cross
Anglican
Church
in
Soweto
for
what
became
the
first
ANC
rally
in
the
country
in
30
years
.

Deafening
chants
of
``
ANC
''
and
``
Umkhonto

we
Sizwe
''
shook
the
church
as
the
seven
aging
men
vowed
that
the
ANC
would
continue
its
fight
against
the
government
and
the
policies
of
racial
segregation
on
all
fronts
,
including
the
armed
struggle
.

And
they
called
on
the
government
to
release
Nelson
Mandela
,
the
ANC
's
leading
figure
,
who
was
jailed
with
them
and
remains
in
prison
.

Without
him
,
said
Mr.
Sisulu
,
the
freeing
of
the
others
``
is
only
a
half-measure
.

''

President
F.W.
de
Klerk
released
the
ANC
men
--
along
with
one
of
the
founding
members
of
the
Pan
Africanist
Congress
,
a
rival
liberation
group
--
as
part
of
his
efforts
to
create
a
climate
of
trust
and
peace
in
which

his
government
can
begin
negotiations
with
black
leaders
over
a
new
constitution
aimed
at
giving
blacks

a
voice
in
national
government
.

But
Pretoria
may
instead
be
creating
a
climate
for
more
turmoil
and
uncertainty
in
this
racially
divided
country
.

As
other
repressive
governments
,
particularly
Poland
and
the
Soviet
Union
,
have
recently
discovered
,
initial
steps
to
open
up
society
can
create
a
momentum
for
radical
change

that
becomes
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
control
.

As
the
days
go
by
,
the
South
African
government
will
be
ever
more
hard
pressed
to
justify
the
continued
imprisonment
of
Mr.
Mandela
as
well
as
the
continued
banning
of
the
ANC
and
enforcement
of
the
state
of
emergency
.

If
it
does
n't
yield
on
these
matters
,
and
eventually
begin
talking
directly
to
the
ANC
,
the
expectations
and
promise
raised
by
yesterday
's
releases
will
turn
to
disillusionment
and
unrest
.

If
it
does
,
the
large
number
of
right-wing
whites
,
who
oppose
any
concessions
to
the
black
majority
,
will
step
up
their
agitation
and
threats
to
take
matters
into
their
own
hands
.

The
newly
released
ANC
leaders
also
will
be
under
enormous
pressure
.

The
government
is
watching
closely
to
see
if
their
presence
in
the
townships
leads
to
increased
anti-government
protests
and
violence
;
if
it
does
,
Pretoria
will
use
this
as
a
reason
to
keep
Mr.
Mandela
behind
bars
.

Pretoria
has
n't
forgotten
why
they
were
all
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
in
the
first
place
:
for
sabotage
and
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
.

In
addition
,
the
government
is
figuring
that
the
releases
could
create
a
split
between
the
internal
and
external
wings
of
the
ANC
and
between
the
newly
freed
leaders
and
those
activists

who
have
emerged
as
leaders
inside
the
country
during
their
imprisonment
.

In
order
to
head
off
any
divisions
,
Mr.
Mandela
,
in
a
meeting
with
his
colleagues
before
they
were
released
,
instructed
them
to
report
to
the
ANC
headquarters
in
Lusaka
as
soon
as
possible
.

The
men
also
will
be
faced
with
bridging
the
generation
gap
between
themselves
and
the
country
's
many
militant
black
youths
,
the
so-called
young
lions

who
are
anxious
to
see
the
old
lions
in
action
.

Says
Peter
Mokaba
,
president
of
the
South
African
Youth
Congress
:
``
We
will
be
expecting
them
to
act
like
leaders
of
the
ANC
.

''

They
never
considered
themselves
to
be
anything
else
.

At
last
night
's
rally
,
they
called
on
their
followers
to
be
firm
,
yet
disciplined
,
in
their
opposition
to
apartheid
.

``
We
emphasize
discipline
because
we
know
that
the
government
is
very
,
very
sensitive
,
''
said
Andrew
Mlangeni
,
another
early
Umkhonto
leader

who
is
now
63
.

``
We
want
to
see
Nelson
Mandela
and
all
our
comrades
out
of
prison
,
and
if
we
are
n't
disciplined
we
may
not
see
them
here
with
us
.

Bad
real
estate
loans
continued
to
gnaw
at
third-quarter
profits
of
Southwestern
banks
,
with
the
notable
exception
of
institutions

that
cleansed
their
books
with
federal
bailouts
.

``
You
've
got
a
two-tiered
market
,
''
said
Frank
W.
Anderson
,
an
analyst
with
Stephens
Inc.
,
Little
Rock
,
Ark
.

On
top
,
he
said
,
are
such
dynamos
as
NCNB
Corp.
and
First
City
Bancorp
of
Texas
,
which
acquired
big
,
ailing
Texas
banks
in
government-assisted
transactions

that
allowed
them
to
slough
off
bad
loans
.

They
are
expected
to
ring
up
big
profits
for
the
third
quarter
,
Mr.
Anderson
said
.

As
for
the
rest
,
warns
James
McDermott
,
an
analyst
with
Keefe
Bruyette
&
Woods
,
New
York
,
``
asset
quality
concerns
are
going
to
dominate
third-quarter
reports
.

''

For
example
,
Bankers
Inc.
,
San
Antonio
,
Texas
,
is
expecting
``
an
uptick
in
{
non-performing
loans
}
related
to
real
estate
''
in
the
third
quarter
,
said
Thomas
Frost
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
.

As
the
only
major
bank
holding
company
in
Texas
to
survive
without
a
bailout
or
merger
,
managed
only
``
very
modest
''
earnings
in
the
period
,
he
said
.

``
If
the
government
handed
me

a
big
bucket
of
money

I
'd
look
good
,
too
,
''
Mr.
Frost
added
.

NCNB
Corp.
's
Texas
operation
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
expected
to
report
an
operating
profit
``
in
line
with
{
or
}
perhaps
a
bit
better
''
than
its
results
in
the
first
two
quarters
,
Timothy
Hartman
,
vice
chairman
of
the
Texas
unit
,
said
.

The
Texas
unit
had
an
operating
profit
of
$
58.7
million
in
the
first
quarter
and
$
55.7
million
in
the
second
quarter
.

NCNB
,
based
in
Charlotte
,
N.C.
,
bought
the
banking
assets
of
failed
First
Republic
Bank
Corp.
of
Dallas
last
year
in
a
transaction
expected
to
cost
the
Federal
Deposit
Insurance
Corp.
about
$
3
billion
.

(
First
Republic
is
n't
related
to
First

Bancorp
of
San
Francisco
.

)
Robert
Rieke
,
an
analyst
with
Raucher
Pierce
Refsnes
Inc.
,
Dallas
,
estimates
Houston-based
First
City
's
third-quarter
net
was
higher
than
second
quarter
earnings
of
$
28.1
million
.

However
,
he
estimated
that
per-share
earnings
stayed
``
relatively
flat
''
at
about
the
second
quarter
's
$
1.19

a
share
because
the
total
number
of
shares
outstanding
increased
.

First
City
was
recapitalized
last
year
by
a
group
led
by
Chicago
banker
A.
Robert
Abboud
.

The
FDIC
contributed
nearly
$
1
billion
to
the
new
organization
.

More
recent
Texas
bailouts
wo
n't
have
much
impact
on
the
third
quarter
results
of
the
new
parent
companies
,
analysts
said
.

These
include
the
sale
of
MCorp
's
failed
banks
to
Banc
One
Corp.
,
Columbus
,
Ohio
;
the
sale
of
National
Bancshares
Corp.
of
Texas
to
Equimark
Corp.
of
Pittsburgh
;
and
the
sale
of
Texas
American
Bancshares
Inc.
's
banking
assets
to
Deposit
Guaranty
Bank
of
Dallas
.

The
transactions
have
n't
yet
been
completed
and
the
Texas
units
are
still
unprofitable
.

Said
Ronald
Steinhart
,
chairman
of
Deposit
Guaranty
:
``
You
wo
n't
see
the
newly
cleansed
bank
in
operation
until
approximately
Dec.
1
.

''

Outside
Texas
,
the
biggest
real
estate
nightmare
for
banks
in
the
region
is
probably
Arizona
.

``
Arizona
is
going
to
be
a
mess
,
''
said
Keefe
Bruyette
's
Mr.
McDermott
.

Several
banks
with
operations
in
Arizona
,
including
First
Interstate
Bancorp.
and
Security
Pacific
Corp.
,
both
of
Los
Angeles
,
have
already
indicated
they
see
asset-quality
problems
.

Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
,
New
York
,
last
month
took
a
$
126
million
charge
against
earnings
related
to
real
estate
loans
at
Chase
Bank
of
Arizona
.

Several
credit
rating
agencies
recently
downgraded
the
senior
debt
of
Valley
National
Corp.
,
warning
that
the
Phoenix-based
bank
holding
company
is
vulnerable
to
the
deteriorating
real
estate
market
.

``
Despite
the
special
addition
to
reserves
in
the
second
quarter
,
Valley
remains
poorly
reserved
against
its
real
estate
exposure
,
''
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc.
said
in
July
.

One
of
the
few
bright
spots
in
the
region
is
Colorado
,
where
a
mild
economic
recovery
has
helped
several
banks
staunch
the
flow
of
red
ink
.

For
instance
,
United
Banks
of
Colorado
Inc.
,
the
state
's
largest
multibank
holding
company
,
resumed
a
cash
dividend
earlier
this
year
after
recording
eight
straight
quarters
of
profitability
.

More
good
news
comes
from
New
Mexico
,
where
banks
did
n't
have
as
much
opportunity
to
get
into
difficulty
in
the
first
place
.

``
The
state
never
grew
fast
enough
to
get
banking
organizations
in
real
trouble
and
the
banking
organizations
were
never
big
enough
to
lend
into
trouble

Common
Cause
asked
both

the
Senate
Ethics
Committee
and
the
Justice
Department
to
investigate
$
1
million
in
political
gifts
by
Arizona
businessman
Charles
Keating
to
five
U.S.
senators

who
interceded
with
thrift-industry
regulators
for
him
.

Mr.
Keating
is
currently
the
subject
of
a
$
1.1
billion
federal
anti-racketeering
lawsuit
accusing
him
of
bleeding
off
assets
of
a
California
thrift

he
controlled
,
Lincoln
Savings
&
Loan
Association
,
and
driving
it
into
insolvency
.

Fred
Wertheimer
--
president
of
Common
Cause
,
the
self-styled
citizens
lobby
--
said
Mr.
Keating
already
has
conceded
attempting
to
buy
influence
with
the
lawmakers
--
Democratic
Sens.
Dennis
DeConcini
of
Arizona
,
Alan
Cranston
of
California
,
John
Glenn
of
Ohio
and
Donald
Riegle
of
Michigan
;
and
GOP
Sen.
John
McCain
of
Arizona
.

Mr.
Wertheimer
based
this
on
a
statement
by
Mr.
Keating

that
was
quoted
in
a
Wall
Street
Journal
story
in
April
:
``
One
question
...
had
to
do
with
whether
my
financial
support
in
any
way
influenced
several
political
figures
to
take
up
my
cause
.

I
want
to
say
in
the
most
forceful
way

I
can
:
I
certainly
hope
so
.

''

In
a
highly
unusual
meeting
in
Sen.
DeConcini
's
office
in
April
1987
,
the
five
senators
asked
federal
regulators
to
ease
up
on
Lincoln
.

According
to
notes
taken
by
one
of
the
participants
at
the
meeting
,
the
regulators
said
Lincoln
was
gambling
dangerously
with
depositors
'
federally
insured
money
and
was
``
a
ticking
time
bomb
.

''
Mr.
Keating
had
complained
that
the
regulators
were
being
too
zealous
.

The
notes
show
that
Sen.
DeConcini
called
the
Federal
Home
Loan
Bank
Board
's
regulations
``
grossly
unfair
,
''
and
that
Sen.
Glenn
insisted
that
Mr.
Keating
's
thrift
was
``
viable
and
profitable
.

''

For
the
next
two
years
,
the
Bank
Board
,
which
at
the
time
was
the
agency
responsible
for
regulating
thrifts
,
failed
to
act
--
even
after
federal
auditors
warned
in
May
1987
that
Mr.
Keating
had
caused
Lincoln
to
become
insolvent
.

Lincoln
's
parent
company
,
American
Continental
Corp.
,
entered
bankruptcy-law
proceedings

this
April
13
,
and
regulators
seized
the
thrift

the
next
day
.

The
newly
formed
Resolution
Trust
Corp.
,
successor
to
the
Bank
Board
,
filed
suit
against
Mr.
Keating
and
several
others
on
Sept.
15
.

Mr.
Keating
has
filed
his
own
suit
,
alleging
that
his
property
was
taken
illegally
.

The
cost
to
taxpayers
of
Lincoln
's
collapse
has
been
estimated
at
as
much
as
$
2.5
billion
.

Details
of
the
affair
have
become
public
gradually
over
the
past
two
years
,
mostly
as
a
result
of
reporting
by
several
newspapers
.

In
the
midst
of
his
1988
re-election
campaign
,
Sen.
Riegle
,
chairman
of
the
Senate
Banking
Committee
,
returned
$
76,000
in
contributions
after
a
Detroit
newspaper
said
that
Mr.
Keating
had
gathered
the
money
for
him
about
two
weeks
before
the
meeting
with
regulators
.

Sen.
DeConcini
,
after
months
of
fending
off
intense
press
criticism
,
returned
$
48,000
only
last
month
,
shortly
after
the
government
formally
accused
Mr.
Keating
of
defrauding
Lincoln
.

In
addition
,
Sen.
McCain
last
week
disclosed
that
he
belatedly
had
paid
$
13,433
to
American
Continental
as
reimbursement
for
trips

he
and
his
family
took
aboard
the
corporate
jet
to
Mr.
Keating
's
vacation
home
at
Cat
Cay
,
the
Bahamas
,
from
1984
through
1986
.

Sen.
McCain
said
he
had
meant
to
pay
for
the
trips
at
the
time
but
that
the
matter
``
fell
between
the
cracks
.

''

Mr.
Keating
,
his
family
members
and
associates
also
donated
$
112,000
to
Sen.
McCain
's
congressional
campaigns
over
the
years
,
according
to
press
accounts
.

But
Sen.
McCain
says
Mr.
Keating
broke
off
their
friendship
abruptly
in
1987
,
because
the
senator
refused
to
press
the
thrift
executive
's
case
as
vigorously
as
Mr.
Keating
wanted
.

``
He
became
very
angry
at
that
,
left
my
office
and
told
a
number
of
people
that
I
was
a
wimp
,
''
Sen.
McCain
recalls
.

In
July
,
California
newspapers
disclosed
that
Mr.
Keating
gave
$
850,000
in
corporate
funds
to
three
tax-exempt
voter
registration
organizations
in
1987
and
1988
at
the
behest
of
Sen.
Cranston
,
who
conceded
that
soliciting
the
money
was
``
a
pretty
stupid
thing
to
do
politically
.

''
In
addition
,
Sen.
Cranston
received
$
47,000
in
campaign
donations
through
Mr.
Keating
,
and
the
California
Democratic
party
received
$
85,000
in
corporate
donations
for
a
1986
get-out-the-vote
drive

that
benefited
the
senator
's
re-election
campaign

that
year
.

Also
in
July
,
Ohio
newspapers
disclosed
$
200,000
in
corporate
donations
by
Mr.
Keating
to
the
National
Council
on
Public
Policy
,
a
political
committee
controlled
by
Sen.
Glenn
.

That
was
in
addition
to
$
34,000
in
direct
campaign
donations
arranged
by
Mr.
Keating
to
the
Ohio
senator
.

Mr.
Wertheimer
said
the
Senate
Ethics
Committee
should
hire
a
special
outside
counsel
to
conduct
an
investigation
,
as
was
done
in
the
case
of
former
House
Speaker
James
Wright
.

Wilson
Abney
,
staff
director
of
the
ethics
panel
,
would
n't
comment
.

Sen.
Riegle
said
he
would
cooperate
with
any
inquiry
,
but
that
his
conduct
had
been
``
entirely
proper
.

''
Sen.
McCain
said
he
had
been
``
deeply
concerned
''
at
the
time
of
the
meeting
that
it
might
seem
to
be
improper
,
but
decided
it
was
``
entirely
appropriate
''
for
him
to
seek
fair
treatment
for
a
constituent
.

Sen.
Glenn
said
he
had
already
made
a
complete
disclosure
of
his
role
in
the
affair
and
``
I
am
completely
satisfied
to
let
this
matter
rest
in
the
hands
of
the
Senate
Ethics
Committee
.

''
Sen.
DeConcini
said
,
``
When
all
is
said
and
done
,
I
expect
to
be
fully
exonerated
.

''

Sen.
Cranston
,
who
had
already
volunteered
his
help
to
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
in
any
investigation
of
Mr.
Keating
,
portrayed
his
role
in
1987
as
prodding
regulators
to
act
.

``
Why
did
n't
the
Bank
Board
act
sooner
?
''
he
said
.

``
That
is
what

Common
Cause
should
ask
be
investigated
.

''


The
inflation-adjusted
growth
rate
for
France
's
gross
domestic
product
for
the
second
quarter
was
revised
upward
to
0.8
%
from
the
previous
three
months
from
the
initial
estimate
of
0.7
%
,
the
National
Statistics
Institute
said
.

The
state
agency
said
the
latest
revision
left
the
growth
rate
for
the
first-quarter
compared
with
the
previous
three
months
unchanged
at
1.3
%
.

If
the
economy
continues
to
expand
by
0.8
%

a
quarter
for
the
rest
of
the
year
,
it
would
leave
GDP
growth
for
all
of
1989
at
3
%
,
the
institute
said
.

That
would
be
down
from
the
3.8
%
rise
posted
in
1988
.

The
debate
over
National
Service
has
begun
again
.

After
a
decade
in
which
more
than
50
localities
established
their
own
service
or
conservation
corps
and
dozens
of
school
systems
made
community
service

a
prerequisite
to
high-school
graduation
,
the
focus
has
shifted
to
Washington
.

At
least
10
bills
proposing
one
or
another
national
program
were
introduced
in
Congress

this
spring
.

One
,
co-sponsored
by
Sen.
Sam
Nunn
(
D.
,
Ga
.

)
and
Rep.
Dave
McCurdy
(
D.
,
Okla.
)
,
would
have
restricted
federal
college
subsidies
to
students

who
had
served
.

An
omnibus
bill
assembled
by
Sen.
Edward
Kennedy
(
D.
,
Mass.
)
,
and
including
some
diluted
Nunn-McCurdy
provisions
along
with
proposals
by
fellow
Democratic
Sens.
Claiborne
Pell
,
Barbara
Mikulski
and
Christopher
Dodd
,
has
been
reported
out
of
the
Senate
Labor
Committee
.

It
might
well
win
Senate
passage
.

President
Bush
has
outlined
his
own
Youth
Entering
Service

(

YES

)
plan
,
though
its
details
remain
to
be
specified
.

What
is
one
to
think
of
all
this
?

Doctrine
and
special
interests
govern
some
responses
.

People
eager
to
have
youth
``
pay
their
dues
to
society
''
favor
service
proposals
--
preferably
mandatory
ones
.

So
do
those

who
seek
a
``
re-energized
concept
of
citizenship
,
''
a
concept
imposing
stern
obligations
as
well
as
conferring
rights
.

Then
there
are
instinctive
opponents
.

To
libertarians
,
mandatory
service
is
an
abomination
and
voluntary
systems
are
illegitimate
uses
of
tax
money
.

Devotees
of
the
market
question

the
value
of
the
work
national
service
would
perform
:
If
the
market
wo
n't
pay
for
it
,
they
argue
,
it
ca
n't
be
worth
its
cost
.

Elements
of
the
left
are
also
reflexively
opposed
;
they
see
service
as
a
cover
for
the
draft
,
or
fear
the
regimentation
of
youth
,
or
want
to
see
rights
enlarged
,
not
obligations
.

But
what
about
those
of
us

whose
views
are
not
predetermined
by
formula
or
ideology
?

How
should
we
think
about
national
service
?

Let
's
begin
by
recognizing
a
main
source
of
confusion
--
``
national
service
''
has
no
agreed
meaning
.

Would
service
be
voluntary
or
compulsory
?

Short
or
long
?

Part-time
or
full-time
?

Paid
or
unpaid
?

Would
participants
live
at
home
and
work
nearby
or
live
in
barracks
and
work
on
public
lands
?

What
kinds
of
work
would
they
do
?

What
does
``
national
''
mean
?

Would
the
program
be
run
by
the
federal
government
,
by
local
governments
,
or
by
private
voluntary
organizations
?

And
who
would
serve
?

Only
males
,
as
with
the
draft
,
or
both

sexes
?

Youth
only
or
all
ages
?

Middle-class
people
,
or
poor
people
,
or
a
genuine
cross-section
?

Many
or
few
?

Those
are
not
trivial
questions
,
and
the
label
``
national
service
''
answers
none
of
them
.

Then
how
should
we
think
about
national
service
?

As
a
starting
point
,
here
are
five
propositions
:

1
.

Consider
the
ingredients
,
not
the
name
.

Ignore
``
national
service
''
in
the
abstract
;
consider
specific
proposals
.

They
will
differ
in
crucial
ways
.

2
.

``
Service
''
should
be
service
.

As
commonly
understood
,
service
implies
sacrifice
.

It
involves
accepting
risk
,
or
giving
up
income
,
or
deferring
a
career
.

It
follows
that
proposals
like
Nunn-McCurdy
,
whose
benefits
to
enrollees
are
worth
some
$
17,500

a
year
,
do
not
qualify
.

There
is
a
rationale
for
such
bills
:
Federal
subsidies
to
college
students
amount
to
``
a
GI
Bill
without
the
GI
''
;
arguably
those
benefits
should
be
earned
,
not
given
.

But
the
earnings
exceed
by
20
%

the
average
income
of
young
high-school
graduates
with
full-time
jobs
.

Why
call
that
service
?

3
.

Encouragement
is
fine
;
compulsion
is
not
.

Compelled
service
is
unconstitutional
.

It
is
also
unwise
and
unenforceable
.

(
Who
will
throw
several
hundred
thousand
refusers
in
jail

each
year
?

)
But
through
tax
policy
and
in
other
ways

the
federal
government
encourages
many
kinds
of
behavior
.

It
should
also
encourage
service
--
preferably
by
all
classes
and
all
ages
.

Its
encouragement
should
strengthen
and
not
undercut
the
strong
tradition
of
volunteering
in
the
U.S.
,
should
build
on
the
service
programs
already
in
existence
,
and
should
honor
local
convictions
about
which
tasks
most
need
doing
.

4
.

Good
programs
are
not
cheap
.

Enthusiasts
assume
that
national
service
would
get
important
work
done
cheaply
:
forest
fires
fought
,
housing
rehabilitated
,
students
tutored
,
day-care
centers
staffed
.

There
is
important
work
to
be
done
,
and
existing
service
and
conservation
corps
have
shown
that
even
youths

who
start
with
few
skills
can
do
much
of
it
well
--
but
not
cheaply
.

Good
service
programs
require
recruitment
,
screening
,
training
and
supervision
--
all
of
high
quality
.

They
involve
stipends
to
participants
.

Full-time
residential
programs
also
require
housing
and
full-time
supervision
;
they
are
particularly
expensive
--
more
per
participant
than
a
year
at
Stanford
or
Yale
.

Non-residential
programs
are
cheaper
,
but
good
ones
still
come
to
some
$
10,000

a
year
.

Are
they

worth

that
?

Evaluations
suggest
that
good
ones
are
--
especially
so
if
the
effects
on
participants
are
counted
.

But
the
calculations
are
challengeable
.

5
.

Underclass
youth
are
a
special
concern
.

Are
such
expenditures
worthwhile
,
then
?

Yes
,
if
targeted
.

People
of
all
ages
and
all
classes
should
be
encouraged
to
serve
,
but
there
are
many
ways
for
middle-class
kids
,
and
their
elders
,
to
serve
at
little
public
cost
.

They
can
volunteer
at
any
of
thousands
of
non-profit
institutions
,
or
participate
in
service
programs
required
by
high
schools
or
encouraged
by
colleges
or
employers
.

Underclass
youth
do
n't
have
those
opportunities
.

They
are
not
enrolled
in
high
school
or
college
.

They
are
unlikely
to
be
employed
.

And
they
have
grown
up
in
unprecedentedly
grim
circumstances
,
among
family
structures
breaking
down
,
surrounded
by
self-destructive
behaviors
and
bleak
prospects
.

But
many
of
them
can
be
quite
profoundly
reoriented
by
productive
and
disciplined
service
.

Some
wo
n't
accept
the
discipline
;
others
drop
out
for
other
reasons
.

But
some

whom

nothing
else
is
reaching
are
transformed
.

Learning
skills
,
producing
something
cooperatively
,
feeling
useful
,
they
are
no
longer
dependent
--
others
now
depend
on
them
.

Even
if
it
is
cheaper
to
build
playgrounds
or
paint
apartments
or
plant
dune-grass
with
paid
professionals
,
the
effects
on
the
young
people
providing
those
services
alter
the
calculation
.

Strictly
speaking
,
these
youth
are
not
performing
service
.

They
are
giving
up
no
income
,
deferring
no
careers
,
incurring
no
risk
.

But
they
believe
themselves
to
be
serving
,
and
they
begin
to
respect
themselves
(
and
others
)
,
to
take
control
of
their
lives
,
to
think
of
the
future
.

That
is
a
service
to
the
nation
.

It
is
what

federal
support
should
try
hardest
to
achieve
.

the
community
wishes
to
develop
with
its
European
partners
,
''
said
Edith
Cresson
,
the
French
minister
for
European
affairs

who
presided
over
a
recent
EC
Council
of
Ministers
meeting
.

As
European
partners
,
Mrs.
Cresson
cited
in
particular
the
members
of
the
European
Free
Trade
Association
,
composed
of
Switzerland
,
Austria
,
Sweden
,
Norway
,
Finland
and
Iceland
.

EC
and
association
ministers
are
scheduled
to
meet
Dec.
19
to
discuss
economic
cooperation
.

Mrs.
Cresson
said
she
hopes
the
talks
will
show
``
a
common
resolve
to
go
beyond
bilateral
,
sectorial
agreements
,
''
such
as
the
one
just
signed
with
Switzerland
.

Swiss
President
Jean-Pascal
Delamuraz
said
the
insurance
pact
could
``
pioneer
''
a
broader
agreement
between
the
Community
and
the
association
.

The
treaty
allows
Swiss
insurance
companies
to
open
branches
in
the
EC
,
and
vice
versa
,
without
restriction
.

But
it
does
n't
permit
selling
insurance
across
borders
without
establishing
branches
.

The
treaty
needs
to
be
approved
by
the
European
Parliament
,
which
is
expected
to
endorse
the
measure
,
EC
officials
said
.

The
agreement
,
which
had
been
16
years
in
the
making
,
covers
general-insurance
services
and
excludes
life
insurance
and
reinsurance
.

Because
Swiss
and
EC
insurers
are
widely
present
on
each
other

's
markets
,
the
accord
is
n't
expected
to
substantially
increase
near-term
competition
.

An
important
element
in
the
accord
,
EC
officials
said
,
is
a
clause

that
provides
for
bilateral
consultations
when
one
party
decides
to
modify
its
internal
insurance
legislation
.

A
joint
panel
would
decide
whether
the
changes
are
compatible
with
the
treaty
or
whether
the
treaty
needs
to
be
amended
to
cope
with
the
changes
.

Mrs.
Cresson
said
a
similar
clause
could
be
useful
in
future
accords
between
the
EC
and
other
countries
.

The
economy
's
temperature
will
be
taken
from
several
vantage
points

this
week
,
with
readings
on
trade
,
output
,
housing
and
inflation
.

The
most
troublesome
report
may
be
the
August
merchandise
trade
deficit
due
out
tomorrow
.

The
trade
gap
is
expected
to
widen
to
about
$
9
billion
from
July
's
$
7.6
billion
,
according
to
a
survey
by
MMS
International
,
a
unit
of
McGraw-Hill
Inc.
,
New
York
.

Thursday
's
report
on
the
September
consumer
price
index
is
expected
to
rise
,
although
not
as
sharply
as
the
0.9
%
gain
reported
Friday
in
the
producer
price
index
.

That
gain
was
being
cited
as
a
reason

the
stock
market
was
down
early
in
Friday
's
session
,
before
it
got
started
on
its
reckless
190-point
plunge
.

Economists
are
divided
as
to
how
much
manufacturing
strength

they
expect
to
see
in
September
reports
on
industrial
production
and
capacity
utilization
,
also
due
tomorrow
.

Meanwhile
,
September
housing
starts
,
due
Wednesday
,
are
thought
to
have
inched
upward
.

``
There
's
a
possibility
of
a
surprise
''
in
the
trade
report
,
said
Michael
Englund
,
director
of
research
at
MMS
.

A
widening
of
the
deficit
,
if
it
were
combined
with
a
stubbornly
strong
dollar
,
would
exacerbate
trade
problems
--
but
the
dollar
weakened
Friday
as
stocks
plummeted
.

In
any
event
,
Mr.
Englund
and
many
others
say
that
the
easy
gains
in
narrowing
the
trade
gap
have
already
been
made
.

``
Trade
is
definitely
going
to
be
more
politically
sensitive
over
the
next
six
or
seven
months
as
improvement
begins
to
slow
,
''
he
said
.

Exports
are
thought
to
have
risen
strongly
in
August
,
but
probably
not
enough
to
offset
the
jump
in
imports
,
economists
said
.

Views
on
manufacturing
strength
are
split
between
economists

who
read
September
's
low
level
of
factory
job
growth
as
a
sign
of
a
slowdown
and
those

who
use
the
somewhat
more
comforting
total
employment
figures
in
their
calculations
.

The
wide
range
of
estimates
for
the
industrial
output
number
underscores
the
differences
:
The
forecasts
run
from
a
drop
of
0.5
%
to
an
increase
of
0.4
%
,
according
to
MMS
.

A
rebound
in
energy
prices
,
which
helped
push
up
the
producer
price
index
,
is
expected
to
do
the
same
in
the
consumer
price
report
.

The
consensus
view
expects
a
0.4
%
increase
in
the
September
CPI
after
a
flat
reading
in
August
.

Robert
H.
Chandross
,
an
economist
for
Lloyd
's
Bank
in
New
York
,
is
among
those
expecting
a
more
moderate
gain
in
the
CPI
than
in
prices
at
the
producer
level
.

``
Auto
prices
had
a
big
effect
in
the
PPI
,
and
at
the
CPI
level

they
wo
n't
,
''
he
said
.

Food
prices
are
expected
to
be
unchanged
,
but
energy
costs
jumped
as
much
as
4
%
,
said
Gary
Ciminero
,
economist
at
Financial
Group
.

He
also
says
he
thinks
``
core
inflation
,
''
which
excludes
the
volatile
food
and
energy
prices
,
was
strong
last
month
.

He
expects
a
gain
of
as
much
as
0.5
%
in
core
inflation
after
a
summer
of
far
smaller
increases
.

Housing
starts
are
expected
to
quicken
a
bit
from
August
's
annual
pace
of
1,350,000
units
.

Economists
say
an
August
rebound
in
permits
for
multifamily
units
signaled
an
increase
in
September
starts
,
though
activity
remains
fairly
modest
by
historical
standards
.

The
first
major
event

this
morning
in
U.S.
stock
and
futures
trading
may
be
a
pause
at
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
.

Under
a
reform
arising
from
the
1987
crash
,
trading
in
the
Merc
's
stock-index
futures
will
break
for
10
minutes
if
the
contract
opens
and
stays
five
points
from
Friday
's
close
,
a
move
equal
to
40
points
on
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

The
aim
of
the
interruption
would
be
to
ease
the
opening
of
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
which
would
be
hammered
by
such
a
volatile
move
on
the
Merc
.

That
early-morning
breather
is
just
one
of
a
number
of
safeguards
adopted
after
the
1987
crash
.

The
Big
Board
also
added
computer
capacity
to
handle
huge
surges
in
trading
volume
.

Several
of
those
post-crash
changes
kicked
in
during
Friday
's
one-hour
collapse
and
worked
as
expected
,
even
though
they
did
n't
prevent
a
stunning
plunge
.

But
the
major
``
circuit
breakers
''
have
yet
to
be
evaluated
.

A
deeper
market
plunge
today
could
give
them
their
first
test
.

A
further
slide
also
would
resurrect
debate
over
a
host
of
other
,
more
sweeping
changes
proposed
--
but
not
implemented
--
after
the
last
crash
.

Most
notably
,
several
of
the
regulatory
steps
recommended
by
the
Brady
Task
Force
,
which
analyzed
the
1987
crash
,
would
be
revived
--
especially
because
that
group
's
chairman
is
now
the
Treasury
secretary
.

The
most
controversial
of
the
Brady
recommendations
involved
establishing
a
single
overarching
regulator
to
handle
crucial
cross-market
questions
,
such
as
setting
consistent
margin
requirements
for
the
stock
and
futures
markets
.

But
for
the
moment
,
attention
focuses
on
the
reforms

that
were
put
into
place
,
and
market
regulators
and
participants
said
the
circuit
breakers
worked
as
intended
.

Big
Board
and
Merc
officials
expressed
satisfaction
with
the
results
of
two
limits
imposed
on
of
the
Merc
's
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
contract
,
as
well
as
``
hot-line
''
communications
among
exchanges
.

Those
pauses
--
from
2:07
p.m.
to
2:30
p.m.
CDT
and
from
2:45
p.m.
until
the
close
of
trading
a
half-hour
later
--
forced
traders
to
buy
and
sell
contracts
at
prices
at
or
higher
than
their
frozen
levels
.

During
the
first
halt
,
after
the
S&P
index
had
fallen
12
points
,
the
Big
Board
's
``
Sidecar
''
computer
program
automatically
was
triggered
.

That
system
is
designed
to
separate
computer-generated
program
trades
from
all
other
trades
to
help
exchange
officials
resolve
order
imbalances
in
individual
stocks
.

One
Merc
broker
compared
the
action
in
the
S&P
pit
during
the
two
freezes
to
a
fire
at
a
well-drilled
school
.

``
You
do
n't
want
the
fire
but
you
know
what
to
do
,
''
said
Howard
Dubnow
,
an
independent
floor
broker
and
a
Merc
governor
.

``
There
was
no
panic
.

The
system
worked
the
way

we
devised
it
to
work
.

''

After
reopening
for
about
15
minutes
,
the
S&P
index
tumbled
to
its
30-point
limit
and
the
second
freeze
went
into
effect
.

Traders
then
spent
the
last
half-hour
``
watching
to
see
if
the
Dow
would
drop
250
points
,
''
Mr.
Dubnow
added
,
referring
to
the
level
at
which

the
stock
market

itself
would
have
closed
for
an
hour
.

One
observer
estimated
that
80
%
to
90
%
of
the
S&P
traders
``
were
just
standing
around
watching
.

''

But
the
250-point
circuit
breaker
never
had
to
kick
in
,
and
freezes
on
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
's
Major
Market
Index
also
were
n't
triggered
.

The
MMI
and
the
S&P
500
are
the
two
major
indexes
used
by
program
traders
to
run
their
computerized
trading
strategies
.

The
programs
are
considered
by
many
to
be
a
major
cause
of
the
1987
crash
.

The
process
of
post-crash
reforms
began
with
calls
to
remake
the
markets
and
wound
up
a
year
later
with
a
series
of
rather
technical
adjustments
.

In
October
1987
,
just
after
the
market
drop
,
Washington
was
awash
in
talk
of
sweeping
changes
in
the
way

the
financial
markets
are
structured
and
regulated
.

Over
the
next
year
that
grand
agenda
was
whittled
down
to
a
series
of
steps
to
soften
big
stock
drops
by
interrupting
trading
to
give
market
players
time
to
pause
and
reconsider
positions
.

In
addition
,
limits
were
placed
on
computer-driven
trading
,
and
steps
were
taken
to
better
link
the
stock
and
futures
markets
.

Few
changes
were
made
in
the
way

the
markets
are
regulated
.

At
the
outset

the
prime
target
was
program
trading
,
which
was
much
discussed
but
little
understood
on
Capitol
Hill
.

There
were
also
calls
to
strip
the
stock
markets
of
``
derivative
''
products
,
such
as
stock-index
futures
and
options
,
which

Federal
Judge
Stanley
Sporkin
,
for
example
,
likened
to
``
barnacles
attached
to
the
basic
market
.

''
And
there
was
much
criticism
of
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
's
system
of
having
stock
trades
flow
through
specialists
,
or
market
makers
.

When
the
Brady
Task
Force
's
powerful
analysis
of
the
crash
was
released
in
January
1988
,
it
immediately
reshaped
the
reformers
'
agenda
.

Arguing
that
the
separate
financial
marketplaces
acted
as
one
,
and
concluding
that
the
crash
had
``
raised
the
possibility
of
a
full-scale
financial
system
breakdown
,
''
the
presidential
task
force
called
for
establishing
a
super-regulator
to
oversee
the
markets
,
to
make
margins
consistent
across
markets
,
to
unify
clearing
systems
and
to
install
circuit
breakers
.

Only
the
last
of
those
recommendations
ever
was
implemented
.

The
Reagan
White
House
held
the
Brady
recommendations
at
arm
's
length
and
named
a
second
panel
--
the
Working
Group
on
the
Financial
Markets
--
to
review
its
analysis
and
those
of
other
crash
studies
.

In
May
1988
,
the
Working
Group
,
made
up
of
representatives
from
the
Federal
Reserve
,
the
Treasury
,
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
,
and
the
Commodity
Futures
Trading
Commission
,
finally
endorsed
only
circuit
breakers
.

After
several
more
months
of
arguments
among
various
stock
exchanges
and
futures
markets
,
circuit
breakers
were
set
in
place
,
with
the
most
notable
suspending
trading
after
250
and
400
point
drops
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

Privately
,
some
free
marketeers
dismissed
such
mechanisms
as
sops
to
interventionists
.

After
all
,
this
free-market
argument
went
,
the
Dow
only
dropped
more
than
250
points
once
this
century
.

``
Circuit
breakers
''
set
to
soften
big
drops
:

--
If
S&P
futures
fall
5
points
at
opening
,
contract
trading
pauses
for
10
minutes
.

--
If
Dow
Industrials
fall
25
points
at
opening
,
contract
trading
pauses
for
10
minutes
.

--
If
S&P
futures
fall
12
points
(
equivalent
to
about
100
points
on
DJIA
)
,
trading
is
frozen
for
half
hour
to
that
price
or
higher
.

On
NYSE
program
trades
are
diverted
into
a
separate
computer
file
to
determine
buy
and
sell
orders
.

--
If
S&P
futures
fall
30
points
,
trading
is
restricted
for
an
hour
to
that
price
or
higher
.

--
If
Dow
Industrials
fall
250
points
,
trading
on
the
Big
Board
halts
for
an
hour
.

S&P
and
MMI
contracts
also
halt
.

--
If
DJIA
drops
400
points
,
Big
Board
halts
trading
for
two
hours
.

Trading
in
MMI
and
S&P
futures
also
halted
.

Brady
Task
Force
recommendations
(
Jan.
1988
)
:

--
Establish
an
overarching
regulator
for
financial
markets

--
Unify
trade-clearing
systems

--
Make
margins
consistent
across
stock
and
futures
markets

SEC
proposals
(
May
1988
)
:

--
Require
prompt
reports
of
large
securities
trades
.

--
Give
SEC
authority
to
monitor
risk-taking
by
affiliates
of
brokerage
firms
.

--
Transfer
jurisdiction
over
stock-related
futures
to
SEC
from
CFTC
.

(
Opposed
by
new
SEC
chairman
)
--
Give
SEC
authority
to
halt
securities
trading
,
(
also
opposed
by
new
SEC
chairman
)
.

Congressional
proposal
:

--
Create
a
task
force
to
review
current
state
of
the
securities
markets
and
securities
laws
.

Breaking

the
Soviet
government
's
television
monopoly
,
an
independent
company
has
gained
rights
to
show
world
programming
,
including
American
films
.

``
There
must
not
be
a
monopoly
,
there
must
be
freedom
of
choice
for
both

journalists
and
viewers
,
''
Nikolai
I.
Lutsenko
,
the
president
of
the
Nika
TV
company
,
told
the
weekly
newspaper
Nedelya
.

The
company
is
already
working
on
its
own
programming
in
several
provincial
cities
and
hopes
to
be
on
the
air
regularly
in
about
a
year
,
the
newspaper
said
.

Mr.
Lutsenko
told
Nedelya
that
he
recently
had
been
to
the
U.S.
to
pick
up
the
rights
to
show
5,000
U.S.
films
in
the
Soviet
Union
.

Nedelya
's
article
was
accompanied
by
a
picture
of
Mr.
Lutsenko
interviewing
singer
John
Denver
in
Colorado
.

Even
though
it
will
be
independent
of
official
television
,
Nika
will
have
an
oversight
board

that
will
include
members
of
the
Communist
youth
league
.

South
Africa
's
National
Union
of
Mineworkers
said
that
about
10,000
diamond
miners
struck
for
higher
wages
at
De
Beers
Consolidated
Mines
Ltd.
De
Beers
said
that
workers
at
five
of
the
group
's
mines
were
on
strike
,
which

it
said
was
peaceful
,
with
orderly
picketing
occurring
at
one
of
the
mines
.

The
deadlock
in
negotiations
occurred
with
De
Beers
offering
a
17
%
increase
in
the
minimum-wage
category
while
the
union
demanded
a
37.6
%
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
.

Japan
's
opposition
Socialist
Party
denied
that
its
legislators
had
been
bribed
by
pinball-parlor
owners
.

The
allegation
had
been
raised
in
Parliament
by
the
governing
Liberal
Democratic
Party
following
magazine
reports
suggesting
that
money
from
Japanese-style
pinball
,
called
pachinko
,
had
infiltrated
politics
.

Tsuruo
Yamaguchi
,
secretary
general
of
the
Socialist
Party
,
acknowledged
that
nine
party
lawmakers
had
received
donations
from
the
pachinko
association
totaling
8
million
yen
(
about
$
55,000
)
but
said
the
donations
were
legal
and
none
of
its
members
acted
to
favor
the
industry
.

The
World
Wide
Fund
for
Nature
said
that
Spain
,
Argentina
,
Thailand
and
Indonesia
were
doing
too
little
to
prevent
illegal
trade
in
endangered
wildlife
across
their
borders
.

A
report
by
the
conservation
group
presented
at
the
U.N.-sponsored
Convention
on
International
Trade
in
Endangered
Species
in
Lausanne
accused
the
four
of
trading
protected
species
ranging
from
parakeets
to
orchids
.

Fund
official
Simon
Lyster
said
world
trade
in
wildlife
was
estimated
to
total
$
5
billion
of
business
annually
.

A
NATO
project
to
build
a
frigate
for
the
1990s
was
torpedoed
by
the
pull-out
of
three
of
its
eight
participating
nations
.

Britain
,
France
and
Italy
announced
technical
reasons
for
withdrawing
,
but
some
officials
pointed
to
growing
reluctance
among
the
allies
to
commit
themselves
to
big
defense
spending
while
East-West
disarmament
talks
show
signs
of
success
.

Small
wonder
that
Britain
's
Labor
Party
wants
credit
controls
.

A
few
hours
after
the
party
launched
its
own
affinity
credit
card
earlier
this
month
,
the
Tories
raised
the
nation
's
base
interest
rate
.

Labor
's
Visa
card
is
believed
to
be
the
first
linked
to
a
British
political
party
.

Labor
gets
25
pence
(
39
cents
)
for
every
100
(
about
$
155
)
that
a
user
charges
to
the
card
.

As
with
other
plastic
in
Britain
's
high-interest-rate
environment
,
the
Labor
card
,
administered
by
Co-operative
Bank
,
carries
a
stiff
(
in
this
case
,
29.8
%
)
annual
rate
on
the
unpaid
balance
.

China
's
year-long
austerity
program
has
achieved
some
successes
in
harnessing
runaway
economic
growth
and
stabilizing
prices
but
has
failed
to
eliminate
serious
defects
in
state
planning
and
an
alarming
drain
on
state
budgets
.

The
official
China
Daily
said
retail
prices
of
non-staple
foods
have
n't
risen
since
last
December
but
acknowledged
that
huge
government
subsidies
were
a
main
factor
in
keeping
prices
down
.

The
State
Statistical
Bureau
found
that
more
than
1
billion
yuan
(
$
270
million
)
was
spent
in
the
first

half
of
the
year
for
pork
subsidies
.

The
newspaper
quoted
experts
as
saying
the
subsidies
would
cause
the
difference
between
prices
and
real
values
of
commodities
to
``
become
very
unreasonable
''
and
reduce
needed
funds
for
investment
in
the
``
already
difficult
state
budget
.

''

The
aim
of
the
austerity
measures
was
to
slice
economic
growth
,
which
soared
to
20.7
%
last
year
,
to
8
%
in
1990
.

Economists
now
predict
the
growth
rate
will
be
about
11.5
%
for
the
year
.

In
a
sign
of
growing
official
tolerance
for
religion
,
Russian
Orthodox
priests
were
allowed
to
celebrate
the
400th
anniversary
of
the
Moscow
patriarchate
in
the
Kremlin
's
15th-century
Uspensky
Cathedral
,
where
czars
were
crowned
...
.

A
34-foot-tall
,
$
7.7
million
statue
of
Buddha
was
completed
on
a
hill
outside
Hong
Kong
,
facing
China
.

The
statue
is
the
brainchild
of
Sik
Chi
Wan
,
director
of
the
Po
Lin
Monastery
,
who
said
:
``
Hong
Kong
is
such
a
prosperous
place
,
we
also
need
some
kind
of
religious
symbol
.

''


``
Time
,
''
says
Tamara
Geva
,
``
is
meaningless
.

My
youth
in
Petrograd
,
my
father
--
whom

I
never
saw
again
after
1924
,
when
I
left
Russia
for
the
West
--
the
whole
of
my
early
life
,
it
's
all
been
brought
back
to
me
by
the
arrival
,
out
of
a
clear
blue
sky
,
of
this
exhibition
.

The
years
between
Petrograd
and
New
York
are
the
dream
.

The
objects
I
grew
up
with
,
the
things
I
thought
I
had
said
goodbye
to
forever
--
that
is
the
reality
.

''

The
reality
to
which

Ms.
Geva
refers
is
the
hoard
of
dance
memorabilia
currently
on
view
at
Eduard
Nakhamkin
Fine
Arts
here
,
under
the
title
,
``
100
Years
of
Russian
Ballet
:
1830-1930
.

''
Consisting
of
roughly
400
items
from
the
Leningrad
State
Museum
of
Theater
and
Music
,
the
show
offers
tantalizing
glimpses
of
a
rich
artistic
achievement
.

For
Ms.
Geva
,
an
actress
and
author

who
began
her
career
as
a
dancer
during
the
early
days
of
the
Soviet
state
under
her
original
name
of
Gevergeyeva
,
it
offers
something
more
:
a
sense
of
completion
,
the
lifting
of
a
curtain
on
the
past
.

A
great
deal
of
what
is
currently
on
display
in
New
York
belonged
to
her
father
.

These
lithographs
,
designs
,
programs
,
photographs
,
which

she
pored
over
day
after
day
,
fed
her
adolescent
yearning
to
join
the
ballet
.

Of
this
ambition
her
father
disapproved
,
because
,
he
said
,
dancers
were
n't
properly
educated
.

Levki
Gevergeyev
had
a
passion
for
learning
and
for
the
arts
,
especially
the
performing
arts
.

In
addition
to
his
holdings
of
theatrical
material
,
he
also
owned
50,000
books
,
among
them

a
great
cache
of
bibles
,
although
,
in
fact
,
he
was
an
atheist
.

That
did
n't
keep
him
from
making
a
great
deal
of
money
manufacturing
gold
vestments
for
the
Russian
Orthodox
Church
.

He
owned
a
26-room
house
,
in
which
,
according
to
his
daughter
,
four
enormous
rooms
were
filled
with
his
collection
.

After
the
Revolution
,
when
everything

he
owned
was
sequestered
by
the
Bolsheviks
,
he
was
put
in
charge
of
the
state
's
first
Museum
of
Theater
and
Music
,
situated
in
Ostrovsky
Square
.

In
effect
,
he
became
the
official
curator
of
his
former
collection
,
which
grew
prodigiously
and
soon
included
several
thousand
costumes
.

Despite
the
deprivations
to
which

her
father
was
subject
in
those
years
,
Ms.
Geva
imagines
that
he
must
have
been
happy
to
be
allowed
to
remain
with
the
objects

he
had
assembled
so
devotedly
.

While
she
found
out
soon
after
the
war
that
he
had
perished
during
the
Siege
of
Leningrad
,
she
did
n't
know
until
the
curators
arrived
from
the
Soviet
Union
with
the
contents
of
this
exhibition
that
he
had
died
of
starvation
on
a
sofa
in
the
museum
.

Though
weakened
by
malnutrition
,
he
was
unwilling
to
budge
in
case

the
collection
was
bombed
and
needed
to
be
saved
.

As
it
happened
,
the
collection
survived
intact
.

Today
,
the
Leningrad
State
Museum
of
Theater
and
Music
owns
some
400,000
items
.

For
Americans
,
the
most
interesting
of
the
400
items
on
display
in
New
York
include
designs
by
the
German-born
Andrei
Roller
(
1805-91
)
for
the
Russian
productions
of
important
early
19th-century
Paris
ballets
.

No
less
illuminating
are
the
designs
from
Petipa
's
``
Sleeping
Beauty
''
(
1890
)
,
``
Nutcracker
''
(
1892
)
and
``
Raymonda
''
(
1897
)
,
which
shed
light
on
the
role
played
by
spectacle
in
the
ballets
of
this
great
choreographer
.

There
also
is
much
to
be
learned
from
the
early
stage
photographs
of
Petipa
's
work
,
which
,
though
posed
,
extend
our
knowledge
of
its
theatrical
ambiance
.

Petipa
,
the
fountainhead
of
balletic
classicism
,
emerges
as
the
show
's
hero
,
whether
perceived
through
scenes
from
his
ballets
or
through
glimpses
of
the
dancers
whose
technique
and
artistry
his
choreography
played
a
decisive
role
in
shaping
.

Among
the
most
important
of
the
Petipa
ballerinas
is
Mathilde
Kchessinska
,
represented
in
a
series
of
fascinating
photographs
.

The
mistress
of
Nicholas
II
until
his
engagement
to
Alexandra
of
Hesse-Darmstadt
,
she
dominated
the
Imperial
Ballet
of
St.
Petersburg
as
much
through
her
dancing
as
through
her
connections
.

Even
Isadora
Duncan
,
the
self-professed
enemy
of
ballet
,
found
her
enchanting
.

A
1910
photograph
shows
Kchessinska
reclining
on
a
chaise
longue
in
her
St.
Petersburg
mansion
.

Clearly
visible
in
the
background
is
the
balcony
from
which
Lenin
was
to
proclaim
the
Revolution
.

The
Diaghilev
material
is
less
interesting
.

The
Ballets
Russes
never
appeared
in
Russia
and
most
of
the
important
artifacts
are
in
the
West
.

George
Balanchine
,
to
whom
Ms.
Geva
was
married
as
a
teenager
in
1923
and
who
began
his
career
as
an
artistic
revolutionary
,
also
gets
short
shrift
.

Better
by
far
is
the
representation
accorded
the
avant-garde
dance

that
flourished
in
the
U.S.S.R.
until
ruthlessly
repressed
during
the
Stalin
years
.

The
presence
of
so
much
material
concerning
Feodor
Lopukhov
,
the
leading
choreographer
of
the
post-Revolutionary
Leningrad
school
,
and
virtually
unknown
in
this
country
,
is
particularly
welcome
.

Less
welcome
is
the
random
nature
of
the
exhibition
,
which
has
no
point
to
make
beyond
the
indisputable
fact
that
there
are
treasures
in
the
Leningrad
State
Museum
of
Theater
and
Music
.

Miscellaneous
and
haphazard
--
did
we
really
need
to
see
Anna
Pavlova
's
tea
set
or
Marie
Petipa
's
slipper
?
--
the
show
invites
uninformed
,
and
thus
superficial
,
viewing
.

While
it
's
an
astonishing
achievement
for
the
Nakhamkin
gallery
to
have
organized
the
show
in
only
three
months
,
the
time
has
surely
come
to
present
this
kind
of
material
in
ways

that
reveal
a
context
and
a
point
of
view
.

Even
the
title
is
misleading
:
The
exhibition
covers
ballet
,
not
in
Russia
,
but
only
in
what
is
now
Leningrad
.

It
also
begins
before
1830
and
ends
after
1930
.

In
compiling
the
catalog
,
the
gallery
has
missed
a
great
opportunity
to
document
a
lot
of
rare
material
.

Though
well-illustrated
,
the
publication
is
uninformative
and
often
simply
untrustworthy
.

Clearly
,
no
dance
lover
should
skip
the
show
,
but
it
's
only
a
stopgap
for
the
serious
,
scholarly
endeavor

we
really
need
.

The
show
closes
in
New
York
on
Oct.
20
and
reopens
in
Saratoga
,
N.Y.
,
on
May
19
at
the
National
Museum
of
Dance

co-sponsor

Roger
Rosenblatt
,
editor
of
U.S.
News
&
World
Report
,
resigned
Friday
from
the
weekly
news
magazine
.

Mr.
Rosenblatt
said
he
resigned
because
of
difficulties
with
commuting
between
his
home
in
New
York
and
the
magazine
's
editorial
offices
in
Washington
.

``
Frankly
,
I
missed
my
family
,
''
said
Mr.
Rosenblatt
.

In
Mr.
Rosenblatt
's
tenure
,
the
magazine
's
advertising
pages
and
circulation
have
grown
significantly
.

But
at
2.3
million
weekly
paid
circulation
,
U.S.
News
still
ranks
third
behind
Time
Warner
Inc.
's
Time
magazine
,
with
4.4
million
circulation
,
and
Washington
Post
Co.
's
Newsweek
,
with
3.3
million
circulation
.

Mortimer
B.
Zuckerman
,
chairman
and
editor
in
chief
,
said
Mr.
Rosenblatt
would
be
succeeded
starting
today
by
Michael
Ruby
,
the
magazine
's
executive
editor
,
and
Merrill
McLoughlin
,
a
senior
writer
.

Mr.
Ruby
and
Ms.
McLoughlin
are
married
to
each
other
.

Mr.
Zuckerman
said
his
magazine
would
maintain
its
editorial
format
,
which
is
a
mix
of
analysis
and
trend
stories
with
service-oriented
,
how-to
articles
.

Mr.
Rosenblatt
,
a
senior
writer
at
Time
magazine
before
joining
U.S.
News
&
World
Report
,
said
he
had
numerous
job
offers
from
other
magazines
while
he
was
editor
.

The
offers
were
to
work
as
a
writer
,
not
an
editor
.

He
said
he
will
now
consider
those
offers
.

Drug
Emporium
Inc.
said
Gary
Wilber
,
39
years
old
,
who
had
been
president
and
chief
operating
officer
for
the
past
year
,
was
named
chief
executive
officer
of
this
drugstore
chain
.

He
succeeds
his
father
,
Philip
T.
Wilber
,
who
founded
the

and
remains
chairman
.

Robert
E.
Lyons

who
headed
the

was
appointed
president

''
we
want
to
clarify
an
erroneous
impression
regarding
the
Villanova
Naval
ROTC
Program
for
1971-1974
.

Joseph
Hebert
III
was
incorrectly
identified
.

He
was
not
an
instructor
at
Villanova
but
was
a
recruiter

who
traveled
to
many
universities
.

The
Naval
ROTC
program
at
Villanova
never
held
meetings
at
fraternity
houses
as
we
have
no
fraternity
houses
.

Villanova
University
and
the
surrounding
community
have
supported
the
Navy
100
%

every
year
since
World
War
II
and
the
university
is
recognized
as
unequaled
in
providing
the
best
of
support
to
the
Navy
.

All

that
occurred
during
the
Vietnam
era
was
an
occasional
sign-carrying
student
near
the
parade
ground
in
peaceful
protest
,
but
no
effort
was
made
to
disrupt
the
Naval
ROTC
activities
.

Villanova
and
the
U.S.
Navy
are
very
proud
of
their
superb
relationship
over
the
past
50
years

order
the
craft
.

A
Lockheed
spokesman
in
Burbank
,
Calif.
,
said
he

was
n't
aware
of
which

other
companies
would
be
competing
for
the
Air
Force
contract
.

Securities
analysts
are
using
terms
like
``
kitchen-sink
syndrome
''
and
``
clearing
the
decks
''
to
describe
the
generally
disappointing
results
that
commercial
banks
are
expected
to
report
in
the
coming
weeks
.

A
number
of
major
banks
have
chosen
to
make
huge
additions
to
their
loan-loss
reserves
in
the
third
quarter
,
either
for
troubled
loans
to
Latin
American
nations
,
soured
real-estate
loans
in
this
country
or
bad
loans
to
companies
involved
in
leveraged
buy-outs
.

The
banks
hope
to
get
the
bad
news
behind
them
now
,
so
that
their
earnings
--
and
their
stock
prices
--
can
rebound
in
the
coming
quarters
.

J.P.
Morgan
&
Co.
has
effectively
neutralized
any
problems
that
its
developing-country
loan
portfolio
could
pose
in
the
future
by
announcing
a
$
2
billion
addition
to
reserves
for
the
quarter
.

As
a
result
,
Morgan
will
post
a
loss
for
the
quarter
and
year
.

Similarly
,
Manufacturers
Hanover
Corp.
made
a
big
addition
to
reserves
for
developing-country
debt

that
will
cause
it
to
post
a
loss
.

Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
on
Wednesday
,
as
expected
,
reported
a
net
loss
for
the
third
quarter
of
$
1.11
billion
,
or
$
12.45

a
share
,
following
a
massive
addition
to
reserves
for
possible
losses
on
loans
primarily
to
developing
countries
.

And
several
regional
banks
,
including
Bank
of
Boston
Corp.
and
First
Bank
System
Inc.
,
are
expected
to
report
losses
stemming
from
major
additions
to
reserves
for
foundering
domestic
loans
.

With
all
this
disappointing
news
,
analysts
would
n't
be
surprised
to
see
other
banks
,
particularly
those
with
loans
to
developing
countries
,
use
the
spate
of
reserve-building
by
others
as
an
opportunity
to
clean
up
their
own
balance
sheets
.

The
nation
's
biggest
banking
company
,
Citicorp
,
is
n't
expected
to
follow
the
lead
of
Manufacturers
,
Chase
and
Morgan
with
a
massive
boost
in
reserves
.

Nevertheless
,
analysts
expect
Citicorp
's
third
quarter
will
be
near
its
level
for
the
same
period

a
year
ago
and
therefore
somewhat
disappointing
.

Many
analysts
were
expecting
generally
weak
third-quarter
results
anyway
due
to
continued
rises
in
non-performing
loans
and
pressure
on
interest-rate
margins
.

Keefe
,
Bruyette
&
Woods
Inc.
,
a
securities
firm
specializing
in
bank
stocks
,
estimates
that
third-quarter
results
will
rise
8
%
from
the
year-ago
figure
for
144
regional
banks
that
it
follows
.

That
's
the
smallest
increase

this
year
.

The
principal
reason
for
the
slower
growth
is
the
narrowing
difference
in
interest
rates
on
loans
and
the
cost
of
interest-bearing
consumer
deposits
.

Keefe
estimates

this
difference
will
shrink
to
4.39
percentage
points
in
the
third
quarter
,
the
lowest
level
in
a
year
.

Further
deterioration
in
domestic
loan
quality
is
adding
to
the
pressure
on
earnings
.

Nonperforming
real-estate
loans
in
New
England
continue
to
climb
,
and
the
number
of
highly
leveraged
commercial
loans

that
have
gotten
into
trouble
is
rising
.

Hooker
International
,
Seaman
Furniture
Co.
,
Lomas
Financial
Group
Inc.
,
Integrated
Resources
Inc.
and
Resorts
International
Inc.
are
some
of
the
more
prominent
troubled
concerns
.

When
China
opened
its
doors
to
foreign
investors
in
1979
,
toy
makers
from
Hong
Kong
were
among
the
first
to
march
in
.

Today
,
with
about
75
%
of
the
companies
'
products
being
made
in
China
,
the
chairman
of
the
Hong
Kong
Toys
Council
,
Dennis
Ting
,
has
suggested
a
new
sourcing
label
:
``
Made
in
China
by
Hong
Kong
Companies
.

''

The
toy
makers
were
pushed
across
the
border
by
rising
labor
and
land
costs
in
the
British
colony
.

But
in
the
wake
of
the
shootings
in
Beijing
on
June
4
,
the
Hong
Kong
toy
industry
is
worrying
about
its
strong
dependence
on
China
.

Although
the
manufacturers
stress
that
production
has
n't
been
affected
by
China
's
political
turmoil
,
they
are
looking
for
additional
sites
.

The
toy
makers
,
and
their
foreign
buyers
,
cite
uncertainty
about
China
's
economic
and
political
policies
.

``
Nobody
wants
to
have
all
his
eggs
in
one
basket
,
''
says
David
Yeh
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
International
Matchbox
Group
Ltd
.

Indeed
,
Matchbox
and
other
leading
Hong
Kong
toy
makers
were
setting
up
factories
in
Southeast
Asia
,
especially
in
Thailand
,
long
before
the
massacre
.

Their
steps
were
partly
prompted
by
concern
over
a
deterioration
of
business
conditions
in
southern
China
.

By
diversifying
supply
sources
,
the
toy
makers
do
n't
intend
to
withdraw
from
China
,
manufacturers
and
foreign
buyers
say
.

It
would
n't
be
easy
to
duplicate
quickly
the
manufacturing
capacity
built
up
in
southern
China
during
the
past
decade
.

A
supply
of
cheap
labor
and
the
access
to
Hong
Kong
's
port
,
airport
,
banks
and
support
industries
,
such
as
printing
companies
,
have
made
China
's
Guangdong
province

a
premier
manufacturing
site
.

``
South
China
is
the
most
competitive
source
of
toys
in
the
world
,
''
says
Henry
Hu
,
executive
director
of
Wah
Shing
Toys
Consolidated
Ltd
.

Hong
Kong
trade
figures
illustrate
the
toy
makers
'
reliance
on
factories
across
the
border
.

In
1988
,
exports
of
domestically
produced
toys
and
games
fell
19
%
from
1987
,
to
HK$
10.05
billion
(
US$
1.29
billion
)
.

But
re-exports
,
mainly
from
China
,
jumped
75
%
,
to
HK$
15.92
billion
.

In
1989
's
first
seven
months
,
domestic
exports
fell
29
%
,
to
HK$
3.87
billion
,
while
re-exports
rose
56
%
,
to
HK$
11.28
billion
.

Manufacturers
say
there
is
no
immediate
substitute
for
southern
China
,
where
an
estimated
120,000
people
are
employed
by
the
toy
industry
.

``
For
the
next
few
years
,
like
it
or
not
,
China
is
going
to
be
the
main
supplier
,
''
says
Edmund
Young
,
vice
president
of
Perfecta
Enterprises
Ltd.
,
one
of
the
first
big
Hong
Kong
toy
makers
to
move
across
the
border
.

In
the
meantime
,
as
manufacturers
and
buyers
seek
new
sites
,
they
are
focusing
mainly
on
Southeast
Asia
.

Several
big
companies
have
established
manufacturing
joint
ventures
in
Thailand
,
including
Matchbox
,
Wah
Shing
and
Kader
Industrial
Co.
,
the
toy
manufacturer
headed
by
Mr.
Ting
.

Malaysia
,
the
Philippines
and
Indonesia
also
are
being
studied
.

With
the
European
Community
set
to
remove
its
internal
trade
barriers
in
1992
,
several
Hong
Kong
companies
are
beginning
to
consider
Spain
,
Portugal
and
Greece
as
possible
manufacturing
sites
.

Worries
about
China
came
just
as
Hong
Kong
's
toy
industry
was
recovering
from
a
1987
sales
slump
and
bankruptcy
filings
by
two
major
U.S.
companies
,
Worlds
of
Wonder
Inc.
and
Coleco
Industries
Inc
.

Hong
Kong
manufacturers
say
large
debt
writeoffs
and
other
financial
problems
resulting
from
the
1987
difficulties
chastened
the
local
industry
,
causing
it
to
tighten
credit
policies
and
financial
management
.

The
industry
regards
last
year
and
this
year
as
a
period
of
recovery

that
will
lead
to
improved
results
.

Still
,
they
long
for
a
``
mega-hit
''
toy
to
excite
retail
sales
in
the
U.S.
,
Hong
Kong
's
biggest
market
for
toys
and
games
.

The
closest
thing

the
colony
's
companies
have
to
a
U.S.
mega-hit

this
year
is
the
Teenage
Mutant
Ninja
Turtles
series
of
action
figures
manufactured
by
Playmates
Holdings
Ltd
.

Introduced
in
mid-1988
,
the
15-centimeter-tall
plastic
turtles
are
based
on
an
American
comic
book
and
television
series
.

Paul
Kwan
,
managing
director
of
Playmates
,
says
10
million
Ninja
Turtles
have
been
sold
,
placing
the
reptilian
warriors
among
the
10
biggest-selling
toys
in
the
U.S
.

Should
sales
continue
to
be
strong
through
the
Christmas
season
,
which
accounts
for
about
60
%
of
U.S.
retail
toy
sales
,
Mr.
Kwan
said
the
Ninja
Turtles
could
make
1989

a
record
sales
year
for
Playmates
.

Other
Hong
Kong
manufacturers
expect
their
results
to
improve
only
slightly
this
year
from
1988
.

Besides
the
lack
of
a
fast-selling
product
,
they
cite
the
continued
dominance
of
the
U.S.
market
by
Nintendo
Entertainment
System
,
an
expensive
video
game
made
by
Nintendo
Co.
of
Japan
.

Nintendo
buyers
have
little
money
left
to
spend
on
other
products
.

Many
of
the
toy
makers
'
problems
started
well
before
June
4
as
a
result
of
overstrained
infrastructure
and
Beijing
's
austerity
programs
launched
late
last
year
.

Toy
makers
complain
that
electricity
in
Guangdong
has
been
provided
only
three
days

a
week
in
recent
months
,
down
from
five
days

a
week
,
as
the
province
's
rapid
industrialization
has
outstripped
its
generating
capacity
.

Manufacturers
are
upgrading
standby
power
plants
.

Bank
credit
for
China
investments
all
but
dried
up
following
June
4
.

Also
,
concern
exists
that
the
harder-line
Beijing
leadership
will
tighten
its
control
of
Guangdong
,
which
has
been
the
main
laboratory
for
the
open-door
policy
and
economic
reforms
.

But
,
toy
manufacturers
and
other
industrialists
say
Beijing
will
be
restrained
from
tightening
controls
on
export-oriented
southern
China
.

They
say
China
's
trade
deficit
is
widening
and
the
country
is
too
short
of
foreign
exchange
for
it
to
hamper
production
in
Guangdong
.

``
The
Chinese
leaders
have
to
decide
whether
they
want
control
or
whether
the
want
exports
,
''
says
Mr.
Kwan
of
Playmates
.

The
Bush
administration
,
urging
the
Supreme
Court
to
give
states
more
leeway
to
restrict
abortions
,
said
minors
have
n't
any
right
to
abortion
without
the
consent
of
their
parents
.

Solicitor
General
Kenneth
Starr
argued
that
the
1973
Supreme
Court
decision
,
Roe
vs.
Wade
,
recognizing
a
constitutional
right
to
abortion
,
was
incorrect
.

He
also
argued
that
the
high
court
was
wrong
in
1976
to
rule
that
minors
have
a
right
to
abortion

that
ca
n't
be
absolutely
vetoed
by
their
parents
.

The
administration
's
position
was
outlined
in
a
friend-of-the-court
brief
filed
in
one
of
three
abortion
cases
the
Supreme
Court
will
hear
argued
and
will
decide
this
term
.

The
administration
filed
the
brief
in
an
appeal
involving
a
Minnesota
law

that
requires
that
both

parents
of
a
minor
be
notified
before
she
may
have
an
abortion
.

The
administration
urged
the
justices
to
adopt
a
legal
standard
suggested
by
Chief
Justice
William
Rehnquist
last
July
when
the
high
court
upheld
Missouri
's
abortion
restrictions
.

Under
that
standard
,
which
garnered
the
votes
of
only
three
of
the
nine
justices
,
a
state
restriction
of
abortion
is
constitutional
if
the
state
has
a
``
reasonable
''
justification
for
adopting
it
.

That
is
a
much
easier
standard
for
a
state
to
satisfy
than
the
Supreme
Court
's
test
since
1973
,
which
requires
a
state
to
have
a
``
compelling
''
reason
for
restricting
abortion
.

On
the
provisions
of
the
Minnesota
law
,
the
Bush
administration
said
that
requiring
that
both

parents
be
notified
is
a
reasonable
regulation
,
and
that
there
is
no
need
to
have
an
alternative

that
allows
minors
to
go
to
court
for
a
judge
's
permission
instead
.

The
case
,
Hodgson
vs.
Minnesota
,
will
be
argued
Nov.
29
.

Dresdner
Bank
AG
of
West
Germany
has
announced
a
friendly
tender
offer
for
control
of
Banque
Internationale
de
Placements
,
a
French
bank

whose
main
shareholder
is
France
's
Societe
Generale
,
the
Societe
de
Bourses
Francaises
said
.

The
tender
offer
by
West
Germany
's
second-biggest
commercial
bank
is
in
two
stages
.

Dresdner
is
offering
to
acquire
32.99
%
of
BIP
's
capital
for
1,015
francs
(
$
156.82
)
a
share
.

The
terms
of
the
offer
put
a
value
of
528
million
francs
(
$
81.6
million
)
on
the
32.99
%
shareholding
.

The
Societe
Generale
banking
group
controls
18.2
%
of
the
shareholding
,
while
Societe
Generale
de
Belgique
S.A.
owns
9.69
%
and
Financiere
Tradition
,
a
holding
company
,
owns
5.1
%
.

Investcorp
,
New
York
,
said
it
and
the
management
of
Sports
&
Recreation
Inc.
bought
the
operator
of
the
10-store
Sports
Unlimited
chain
for
some
$
40
million
.

The
investment
bank
becomes
majority
shareholder
in
Sports
&
Recreation
,
a
10-year-old
sporting
goods
retailer
,
said
Oliver
E.
Richardson
,
a
member
of
Investcorp
's
management
committee
and
a
director
of
the
chain
.

Sports
Unlimited
,
Tampa
,
Fla.
,
posted
revenue
of
$
59
million
for
the
year
ended
July
31
.

The
company
is
``
very
profitable
''
on
an
operating
basis
,
Mr.
Richardson
said
,
but
he
declined
to
specify
numbers
.

In
1982
,
Sports
&
Recreation
's
managers
and
certain
passive
investors
purchased
the
company
from
Brunswick
Corp.
of
Skokie
,
Ill
.

In
the
latest
transaction
,
management
bought
out
the
passive
investors
'
holding
,
Mr.
Richardson
said
.

With
stock
prices
hovering
near
record
levels
,
a
number
of
companies
have
been
announcing
stock
splits
.

But
investors
trying
to
play
all
the
angles
may
find
that
stock
splits
are
a
lot
like
cotton
candy
:
They
look
tempting
,
but
there
's
hardly
any
substance
.

And
they
can
even
leave
a
sticky
problem
,
in
the
form
of
higher
brokerage
commissions
.

``
A
stock
split
unaccompanied
by
a
cash
dividend
increase
is
like
giving
somebody

five
singles
for
a
$
5
bill
.

You
've
got
a
thicker
billfold
,
but
it
has
no
economic
significance
whatsoever
,
''
says
Leon
Cooperman
,
a
partner
at
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.

In
a
typical
split
,
a
company
increases
the
number
of
shares

it
has
outstanding
,
with
each
stockholder
participating
on
the
basis
of
existing
holdings
.

With
a
2-for-1
split
,
for
example
,
an
investor

who
owned
100
shares
before
the
split
would
have
200
shares
afterward
.

The
stock
's
price
usually
falls
to
reflect
the
greater
number
of
shares
,
assuming
no
other
changes
at
the
company
.

Companies
usually
split
their
shares
in
the
hope
that
a
lower
share
price
will
attract
more
individual
investors
,
increase
trading
volume
and
improve
the
stock
's
liquidity
.

The
theory
is
that
a
stock
selling
for
$
20
or
$
30

a
share
will
be
more
affordable
to
individuals
than
one
selling
for
more
than
$
100
--
especially
for
investors

who
like
to
buy
round
lots
of
100
shares
.

Take
L.A.
Gear
Inc.
,
a
fast-growing
designer
and
marketer
of
athletic
footwear

that
had
a
2-for-1
split
last
month
.

The
main
reason
for
the
split
was
``
to
make
the
stock
more
attractive
to
the
retail
buyer
,
''
says
Elliott
J.
Horowitz
,
the
company
's
executive
vice
president
and
chief
financial
officer
.

But
if
a
stock
suddenly
becomes
more
attractive
to
the
masses
,
should
n't
that
boost
its
price
?

After
all
,
L.A.
Gear
was
selling
for
around
$
60

a
share
when
the
split
was
announced
on
Aug.
24
,
then
soared
to
more
than
$
75

a
share
before
splitting
in
late
September
.

Yesterday
,
the
stock
closed
at
$
41.75
.

Mr.
Horowitz
scoffs
at
the
idea
that
his
company
's
price
surge
was
caused
by
the
split
.

``
If
it
were
that
easy
to
take
a
stock
from
60
to
75
,
I
think
a
lot
of
other
companies
would
be
doing
it
,
''
he
says
.

While
a
split
``
does
create
more
demand
for
the
stock
,
''
he
says
,
``
I
just
do
n't
think
it
's
that
much
of
a
factor
.

''

Investment
managers
and
others
agree
.

While
a
stock
split
accompanied
by
a
dividend
increase
can
pack
a
powerful
punch
,
a
split
by
itself
``
has
no
lasting
impact
on
the
stock
price
,
''
says
Mr.
Cooperman
of
Goldman
Sachs
.

Adds
James
L.
Cochrane
,
senior
vice
president
at
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
:
``
We
've
done
research
on
this
,
and
it
shows
a
split
really
does
n't
to
seem
to
matter
significantly
.

''

Even
if
splits
did
affect
stock
prices
,
some
academics
argue
that
it
would
be
futile
for
investors
to
try
to
take
advantage
of
them
.

In
their
view
,
financial
markets
tend
to
anticipate
news
.

Thus
any
impact
from
a
split
would
already
be
incorporated
in
a
stock
's
price
by
the
time

the
split
was
announced
,
they
argue
.

``
Normally
,
the
investor
is
n't
able
to
benefit
''
by
buying
a
company
's
stock
immediately
after
news
of
a
split
,
says
Frank
K.
Reilly
,
a
Notre
Dame
professor
of
finance
and
co-author
of
a
1981
study
on
splits
.

``
By
the
time

the
average
investor
hears
the
news
,
traders
already
have
acted
and
the
stock
already
has
moved
.

''

A
few
money
managers
even
say
a
stock
split
sometimes
may
represent
a
sell
signal
.

``
Remember
the
old
Wall
Street
adage
:
Buy
on
the
rumor
and
sell
on
the
news
,
''
says
Samuel
Thorne
Jr.
,
a
managing
director
at
Scudder
,
Stevens
&
Clark
in
Boston
.

Splits
can
also
mean
a
bigger
expense
for
investors
when
they
buy
or
sell
shares
.

That
's
because
brokerage
houses
often
calculate
their
commission
rates
using
a
complex
formula
based
partly
on
the
number
of
shares
being
traded
.

For
example
,
a
Merrill
Lynch
official
says
that
firm
's
commission
on
100
shares
of
a
$
40
stock
would
be
about
$
97
.

But
the
commission
would
jump
to
about
$
115
to
trade
200
shares
of
a
$
20
stock
--
even
though
the
dollar
amount
of
the
trade
would
be
exactly
the
same
.

Another
large
firm
gave
similar
figures
:
The
standard
commission
on
100
shares
of
a
$
40
stock
would
be
$
91
,
but
the
commission
would
jump
to
$
112.50
to
trade
200
shares
of
a
$
20
stock
.

``
Stock
splits
are
the
biggest
ripoff
on
Wall
Street
,
''
contends
Hans
R.
Reinisch
,
a
New
York
investor
.

``
The
only
thing
that
changes
with
a
split
is
the
brokerage
commissions
,
and
they
often
go
up
sharply
.

If
you
're
an
active
investor
,
you
have
to
take
into
account

the
transaction
costs
.

''

Some
corporate
executives
also
question
the
idea
that
more
shares
are
better
.

Among
these
is
Warren
E.
Buffett
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Berkshire
Hathaway
Inc.
,
whose
stock
closed
yesterday
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
at
$
8,700

a
share
.

``
We
often
are
asked
why
Berkshire
does
not
split
its
stock
,
''
he
wrote
in
the
company
's
1983
annual
report
.

``
The
assumption
behind
this
question
usually
appears
to
be
that
a
split
would
be
a
pro-shareholder
action
.

We
disagree
.

''

In
the
lengthy
discussion
that
followed
,
Mr.
Buffett
said
:
``
We
want
{
shareholders
}
who
think
of
themselves
as
business
owners
with
the
intention
of
staying
a
long
time
.

And
,
we
want
those

who
keep
their
eyes
focused
on
business
results
,
not
market
prices
.

''

Underscoring
his
feelings
on
the
subject
,
Mr.
Buffett
once
sent
a
birthday
greeting
to
a
friend
,
wishing
him
good
health
and
saying
:
``
May
you
live
until
Berkshire
splits
.

''

Still
,
many
companies
like
splits
as
an
inexpensive
marketing
tool

that
generates
favorable
publicity
and
helps
broaden
their
shareholder
base
.

A
stock
split
is
``
a
nice
exercise
in
cosmetics
,
but
that
's
about
all
,
''
says
James
H.
Coxon
,
senior
vice
president
and
head
of
the
common-stock
division
at
Cigna
Investments
Inc
.

``
It
's
a
small
net
positive
because
it
can
improve
the
marketability
of
a
particular
stock
.

But
it
's
really
of
very
little
significance
.

''

A
split
's
impact
,
if
any
,
can
depend
on
the
company
involved
and
the
price
of
that
company
's
stock
,
says
John
P.
Rosenthal
,
senior
partner
of
Silberberg
,
Rosenthal
&
Co
.

But
he
adds
that
any
impact
from
a
split
``
really
is
very
short-term
.

''

Advises
Michael
Metz
,
a
managing
director
at
Oppenheimer
&
Co
:
``
Just
ignore
splits
.

''
In
his
view
,
``
They
're
irrelevant
for
the
long-term
investor
.

Look
only
at
the
fundamentals
of
a
company
,
not
whether
it
splits
its
stock
.

``
Snoozing
''
through
the
Beijing
massacre
?

This
is
the
buzzword
Adi
Ignatius
chooses
to
characterize
in
his
review
of
my
book
``
Tiananmen
Diary
:
Thirteen
Days
in
June
''
(
Leisire
&
Arts
,
Sept.
8
)
.

I
doubt
that
many
readers
of
this
chronicle
of
the
blood
and
bullets
and
terror
of
the
Beijing
massacre
would
put
it
just
this
way
.

Nor
mistake
,
as
he
seems
to
have
done
,
a
raw
,
rough-cut
,
unretouched
,
genuine
diary
,
complete
with
blips
,
print
lice
and
all
the
confusions
of
real
time
with
high-gloss
footnoted
academic
scholarship
.

Such
works
will
be
forthcoming
,
but
I
doubt
if
they
will
convey
the
anguish
of
what

Mr.

calls
my
``

Marlene
Dash
would
appear
to
be
a
marketer
's
dream
come
true
.

The
corporate
manager
likes
to
dress
smartly
,
both
on
and
off
the
job
.

She
owns
a
condominium
in
Chicago
and
takes
pride
in
furnishing
it
well
.

Yet
Ms.
Dash
,
in
her
mid-30s
,
loathes
shopping
.

Lousy
service
and
poor
selections
at
many
stores
have
turned
a
once
favorite
pastime
into
what

she
calls
a
``
frustrating
''
experience
.

These
days
,
she
would
rather
exercise
,
visit
friends
or
read
.

``
If
you
do
n't
make
it
reasonably
easy
for
me
,
''
she
says
of
shopping
,
``
I
'm
not
going
to
waste
my
time
.

''

Ms.
Dash
is
far
from
alone
.

Shopping
has
become
such
a
chore
that
more
people
hate
browsing
in
stores
than
hate
doing
household
work
,
according
to
The
Wall
Street
Journal
's
``
American
Way
of
Buying
''
survey
.

Nearly
a
third
of
the
2,064
people
interviewed
by
the
pollster
Peter
D.
Hart
Research
Associates
said
they
``
do
not
enjoy
at
all
''
window-shopping
or
browsing
.


Yankelovich
,
Clancy
,
Shulman
,
a
market
research
firm
in
Westport
,
Conn.
,
warns
clients
that
Americans
'
love
affair
with
shopping
is
on
the
rocks
:
More
than
half
the
women

it
has
surveyed
in
recent
years
,
and
an
even
larger
percentage
of
men
,
say
shopping
for
clothes
is
a
hassle
.

Stressed-out
consumers
--
juggling
jobs
,
families
and
leisure
activities
--
feel

they
have
less
time
to
shop
.

They
also
complain
about
obnoxious
and
poorly
trained
salespeople
,
lower
quality
merchandise
and
exorbitant
prices
.

But
underlying
these
complaints
is
a
more
far-reaching
change
:
For
many
shoppers
,
the
thrill
is
gone
.

Back
in
the
1970s
,
when
malls
were
sprouting
across
the
country
,
consumers
were
content
to
browse
away
an
afternoon
and
buy
whatever
struck
their
fancy
.

Then
in
the
early
1980s
,
Americans
viewed
shopping
as
a
quest
for
the
trendiest
merchandise
or
the
best
bargains
they
could
brag
about
to
their
friends
.

Now
,
on
the
eve
of
the
1990s
,
consumer
researchers
say
that
for
most
people
,
shopping
is
simply
less
fun
.

Retailers
hawk
look-alike
merchandise
in
stores

that
are
numbingly
similar
in
appearance
.

Shopping
has
become
``
just
one
of
the
activities
that
we
have
to
do
,
''
says
Susan
Hayward
of
Yankelovich
.

``
It
's
not
an
end
in
itself
anymore
.

''

In
the
Journal
poll
,
more
than
a
third
of
the
people
interviewed
said
they
probably
would
n't
spend
a
free
hour
poking
around
in
stores
,
even
if
a
prime
shopping
district
were
nearby
.

That
is
n't
to
say
consumers
do
n't
like
new
things
.

But
when
they
go
to
a
store
today
,
they
're
more
likely
to
think
of
the
trip
as
a
mission
rather
than
an
adventure
.

``
They
're
buyers
as
opposed
to
shoppers
,
''
says
Thomas
Rauh
,
a
retail
consultant
at
the
accounting
firm
of
Ernst
&
Young
.

Surveys
and
focus-group
research
show
that
most
people
are
indeed
shopping
more
purposefully
.

Consumers
visit
fewer
stores
per
trip
(
an
average
of
three
last
year
,
down
from
3.6
in
1982
,
according
to
consultant
Stillerman
Jones
&
Co
.

)
and
spend
less
time
in
malls
(
an
average
of
68
minutes
per
trip
last
year
,
down
from
90
minutes
in
1982
)
.

``
I
leave
rather
than
hunt
for
something
,
''
snaps
Lisa
Max
,
a
46-year-old
real
estate
broker
in
New
York
.

Despite
such
negative
attitudes
,
retailers
generally
say
consumers
are
n't
cutting
back
on
what

they
buy
.

``
If
it
is
dropping
off
,
it
would
be
more
likely
that
they
're
shopping
less
often
and
buying
more
when
they
do
shop
,
''
says
Michael
Wellman
,
vice
president
of
marketing
at
K
mart
Corp
.

``
There
's
no
question
our
customers
'
time
has
become
more
valuable
than
ever
,
''
says
Stephen
Watson
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Dayton
Hudson
Corp.
's
department
store
unit
.

But
he
contends
the
company
's
record
sales
and
profits
indicate
it
is
making
the
shopping
experience
easier
.

For
example
,
the
company
is
hiring
more
sales
people
than
in
the
past
and
paying
them
more
.

It
also
is
laying
out
remodeled
and
new
stores
with
a
center-aisle
design
and
installing
escalators
and
elevators
in
more
convenient
central
locations
.

Of
course
,
there
are
still
people
for
whom
shopping
is
a
joy
,
even
a
passion
.

But
some
of
those
people
have
complaints
,
too
.

Take
Cyd
Hinman
,
a
mother
of
two
from
Norwood
,
Mass
.

She
often
enjoys
shopping
,
but
is
so
fed
up
with
the
clerks
at
a
nearby
Filene
's
department
store
that
she
refers
to
them
as
``
idiots
.

''

Twice
,
Mrs.
Hinman
picked
merchandise
off
Filene
's
racks
labeled
with
``
sale
''
signs
,
only
to
be
told
when
she
got
to
the
cash
register
that
the
goods
were
n't
on
special
.

The
second
time
,
she
demanded
that
she
receive
the
discount
anyway
,
and
the
clerk
gave
in
.

``
I
'm
willing
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
,
''
she
says
,
``
but
not
if
I
feel
like
I
'm
getting
jerked
around
.

''

Complaints
about
service
are
so
widespread
that
six
of
10
people
in
the
Journal
survey
said
they
have
boycotted
stores
because
of
the
way

they
were
treated
.

The
percentage
was
even
higher
--
roughly
three-quarters
--
among
professionals
and
those
earning
more
than
$
50,000

a
year
.

Service
has
declined
just
at
a
time
when
consumers
are
more
impatient
than
ever
.

``
The
whole
tone
of
voice
is
different
now
in
terms
of
what
people
expect
from
a
store
,
''
says
William
Ress
,
whose

Columbus
,
Ohio
,
management
consulting
firm
has
surveyed
consumers
for
more
than
20
years
.

Despite
the
rising
resentment
,
few
stores
are
making
shopping
more
appealing
.

Sales
people
spraying
perfume
still
assault
shoppers
at
many
department
stores
,
even
though
some
consumers
complain
that
the
spritzers
could
provide
a
far

more
useful
service
if
they
were
trained
to
operate
a
cash
register
.

Consumers
want
selection
to
be
easy
and
efficient
,
but
that
's
not
what

most
merchandisers
want
.

Retailers
generally
go
to
lengths
to
keep
shoppers
in
their
stores
as
long
as
possible
.

Many
stores
,
for
example
,
require
customers
to
walk
through
a
maze
of
boutiques
designed
to
show
off
their
wares
just
to
find
,
say
,
a
simple
white
blouse
.

But
rather
than
tempt
people
to
buy
more
,
consumer
researchers
say
,
this
tactic
just
irritates
many
shoppers
.

Over
half
the
respondents
in
the
Journal
survey
said
they
rarely
buy
on
impulse
anyway
.

So
what
should
a
retailer
do
?

``
Those

that
do
the
best
job
of
making
the
shopping
experience
enjoyable
and
making
the
customer
feel
like
a
human
being
are
very
well
rewarded
,
''
says
Leo
J.
Shapiro
,
a
market
researcher
in
Chicago
.

He
cites
Nordstrom
Inc.
,
the
Seattle-based
department
store
.

The
chain
's
strategy
:
pay
sales
people
an
incentive
to
provide
good
service
and
keep
more
merchandise
in
stock
than
competitors
.

Other
retailers
are
trying
to
mollify
miffed
shoppers
by
doing
away
with
their
decades-old
practice
of
setting
high
``
regular
''
prices

that
can
later
be
cut
to
``
sale
''
levels
.

Under
a
new
approach
being
hyped
as
``
everyday
low
pricing
,
''
retailers
such
as
Sears
,
Roebuck
&
Co.
now
run
fewer
sales
.

Instead
,
they
set
prices
between
their
old
``
sale
''
and
``
regular
''
prices
.

Last
month
,
R.H.
Macy
&
Co.
started
promising
in
ads
that
shoppers
in
search
of
women
's
coats
could
``
cut
through
all
the
confusing
sales
,
special
buys
and
clearances
out
there
''
and
pay
what

Macy
's
says
is
the
``
lowest
prices
...

every
day
.

''

Sears
started
its
``
everyday
pricing
''
approach
in
March
,
but
so
far
sales
results
do
n't
reflect
strong
consumer
response
.

Still
,
such
a
pricing
strategy
just
might
appeal
to
people
like
Connie
Bates
,
a
respondent
in
the
Journal
survey
.

She
recently
walked
out
of
a
furniture
store
because
the
salesman
offered
to
cut
the
price
of
a
sectional
couch
three
times
.

When
a
store
keeps
dropping
prices
,
the
Farmington
,
Mich.
,
resident
says
,
``
I
get
suspicious
that
they
're
trying
to
get
the
most

they
can
out
of
you
.

Corp.
,
this
week
arranged
the
syndication
of
a
$
50
million
,
five-year
loan
to
Shortridge
Ltd.
,
which
is
owned
by
China
International
Trust
&
Investment
Corp
.

(
Holdings
)
,
or
Citic
.

The
loan
will
be
used
for
Shortridge
's
share
of
the
purchase
of
a
satellite
,
a
BT
Asia
director
said
.

The
other
unit
,
Chase
Manhattan
Asia
Ltd.
,
a
Hong
Kong
subsidiary
of
Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
,
of
New
York
,
said
it
is
underwriting
a
$
50
million
loan
for
China
's
biggest
trading
company
,
China
Resources
(
Holdings
)
Co.
,
for
general
corporate
purposes
.

Of
the
total
,
$
30
million
can
be
swapped
into
marks
.

Amid
the
international
outcry
following
the
shooting
of
students
and
bystanders
in
Beijing
on
June
4
,
foreign-bank
lending
to
China
came
to
a
halt
.

Bankers
in
Hong
Kong
said
this
week
's
Citic
loan
was
an
important
sign
that
foreign
banks
are
interested
in
resuming
regular
business
with
China
.

``
It
's
sort
of
a
benchmark
,
''
said
a
U.S.
banker

who
did
n't
participate
in
the
loan
.

Russell
L.
Magarity
,
senior
managing
director
of
Chase
Manhattan
Asia
,
said
``
it
is
time
''
to
start
considering
loans
to
China
again
.

Mr.
Magarity
said
Chase
hopes
to
assemble
an
international
group
of
banks
in
the
lending
syndicate
,
including
some
of
U.S.
and
Japanese
banks
with
which

China
Resources
has
had
a
strong
relationship
in
recent
years
.

``
Right
now
we
think
we
can
successfully
syndicate
this
loan
because
of
China
Resources
'
name
,
''
he
said
.

Indeed
,
the
reputations
of
China
Resources
and
Citic
played
a
significant
role
in
the
decisions
.

China
Resources
and
Citic
are
considered
exceptionally
good
credit
risks
,
bankers
said
.

Other
loans
to
China
will
have
to
be
considered
on
a
case-by-case
basis
.

Beyond
the
political
considerations
,
banks
are
concerned
about
the
state
of
China
's
economy
and
about
borrowers
'
ability
to
make
loan
payments
.

Now
that
the
first
major
syndication
of
a
Chinese
loan
has
proceeded
smoothly
,
a
Japanese
banker
said
it
will
be
easier
for
foreign
banks
to
consider
making
loans
to
China
.

Citic
,
which
acts
as
a
sort
of
merchant
bank
for
overseas
acquisitions
by
China
,
is
a
relatively
independent
company
.

Through
Shortridge
,
it
is
one
of
three
partners
in
Asia
Satellite
Telecommunications
Co.
,
which
plans
to
launch
a
private
satellite
on
a
Chinese
rocket
next
year
.

The
other
partners
are
Cable
&
Wireless
PLC
of
Britain
and
Hutchison
Whampoa
Ltd.
of
Hong
Kong
.

Citic
guaranteed
the
loan
.

The
loan
was
syndicated
to
a
group
of
foreign
banks
from
Europe
,
Hong
Kong
and
Canada
,
foreign
bankers
said
;
they
did
n't
identify
the
institutions
.

BT
Asia
arranged
the
syndication
but
did
n't
underwrite
the
loan
.

A
BT
Asia
official
would
n't
disclose
all
the
terms
of
the
loan
but
said
it
was
linked
to
a
currency
option

that
allows
banks
to
receive
repayment
in
yen
instead
of
dollars
.

The
official
said
Citic
will
pay
an
interest
rate

that
will
be
about
0.5
percentage
point
higher
than
the
amount
Citic
would
have
paid
for
a
similar
borrowing
before
June
4
.

He
said
it
was
difficult
to
calculate
the
exact
interest
rate
because
of
the
currency
option
.

Bankers
said
they
believe
China
Resources
'
loan
costs
have
risen
by
about
the
same
amount
.

Walker
Telecommunications
Corp.
said
it
plans
to
repurchase
as
many
as
one
million
shares
from
time
to
time
,
depending
on
the
state
of
the
market
.

The
supplier
of
electronic
key
telephone
systems
has
5.1
million
shares
outstanding
and
will
purchase
the
shares
in
the
market
,
and
or
in
privately
negotiated
transactions
.

In
national
over-the-counter
trading
,
Walker
shares
closed
yesterday
at
90.625
cents
,
up
21.875
cents
.

Aluminum
Co.
of
America
,
hit
hard
by
the
strength
of
the
dollar
overseas
,
said
net
income
for
the
third
quarter
dropped
3.2
%
to
$
219
million
,
or
$
2.46

a
share
.

The
nation
's
No.
1
aluminum
maker
earned
$
226.3
million
,
or
$
2.56

a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

Revenue
rose
11
%
to
$
2.83
billion
from
$
2.56
billion
.

Analysts
,
who
were
expecting
Alcoa
to
post
around
$
2.70
to
$
3

a
share
,
were
surprised
at
the
lackluster
third-quarter
results
.

``
It
's
disappointing
,
''
said
William
Siedenburg
,
an
analyst
with
Smith
Barney
,
Harris
Upham
&
Co
.

Much
of
the
earnings
decline
was
led
by
currency-exchange
rate
adjustments
,
which
affected
the
bottom
line
by
$
15.3
million
,
or
17
cents

a
share
,
compared
with
$
3.6
million
,
or
four
cents

a
share
,
the
previous
year
.

Lower
prices
for
aluminum
ingots
and
certain
alloy
products
and
a
shift
in
the
product
mix
also
contributed
to
lower
earnings
,
the
company
said
.

``
In
addition
,
costs
were
higher
partly
due
to
scheduled
plant
outages
for
modernization
work
,
''
the
company
said
.

Excluding
the
higher
tax
rate
,
which
rose
two
percentage
points
to
38
%
,
and
the
negative
exchange
rate
adjustment
,
the
company
would
have
met
analysts
'
expectations
,
said
R.
Wayne
Atwell
,
an
analyst
with
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.

Noting
that
the
third
quarter
is
usually
the
aluminum
industry
's
slowest
,
Mr.
Atwell
added
,
``
the
third
quarter
is
never
a
bang
up
period
for
them
anyway
.

''

Nevertheless
,
the
company
said
shipments
were
up
slightly
to
679,000
metric
tons
from
671,000
,
buffing
the
impact
of
the
unexpected
earning
decline
.

The
results
were
announced
after
the
stock
market
closed
.

In
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
Friday
,
Alcoa
closed
at
$
72

a
share
,
down
$
4.75
,
in
a
sharply
lower
market
.

Your
Sept.
15
story
on
the
destroyer
DDG-51
,
the
Arleigh
Burke
,
inaccurately
asserts
,
``
several
aluminum-hulled
British
ships
were
destroyed
by
Argentine
missiles
.

''

Only
one
aluminum-hulled
British
vessel
was
so
destroyed
,
the
HMS
Sheffield
.

It
was
struck
by
an
Exocet
,
setting
off
fires

that
ignited
its
aluminum
superstructure
.

As
far
as
I
know
,
there
is
no
way
to
extinguish
such
a
fire
at
sea
,
which
is
why
the
U.S.
Navy
has
sensibly
built
the
Burke
of
steel
.

However
,
the
Navy
also
claims
that
its
mostly
aluminum
Aegis-class
cruisers
,
some
of
which
are
yet
to
be
built
,
could
never
meet
the
fate
of
the
Sheffield
because
no
enemy
missile
could
penetrate
their
defenses
.

Frank
H.
Price
Jr

Birmingham
,
Ala
.

Lomas
Financial
Corp.
,
Dallas
,
said
it
will
ask
a
U.S.
bankruptcy
court
to
allow
it
to
hire
Lazard
Freres
&
Co.
to
help
it
sell
its
leasing
unit
.

Lomas
,
assisted
by
Merrill
Lynch
Capital
Markets
,
has
been
trying
to
sell
its
Equitable
Lomas
Leasing
Co.
for
several
months
,
apparently
without
success
.

The
real
estate
and
mortgage
banking
concern
had
hoped
to
use
proceeds
from
the
sale
to
reduce
its
debt
.

Without
cash
from
asset
sales
and
unable
to
reach
a
new
bank-credit
agreement
,
Lomas
defaulted
on
$
145
million
in
notes

that
became
due
Sept.
1
.

It
filed
for
protection
from
creditors
under
Chapter
11
of
the
federal
Bankruptcy
Code
Sept.
24
to
give
it
additional
time
to
work
on
a
plan
to
restructure
its
$
1.45
billion
in
senior
debt
.

Lomas
said
Merrill
Lynch
,
which
owns
bonds
and
equity
in
Lomas
,
could
n't
continue
as
Lomas
's
investment
banker
because
it
is
also
a
creditor
.

It
said
it
chose
Lazard
in
part
because
of
Lazard
's
offices
in
Europe
and
Japan
,
where
investors
might
be
interested
in
a
U.S.
leasing
company
.

Put
down
that
phone
.

Walk
around
the
room
;
take
two
deep
breaths
.

Resist
the
urge
to
call
your
broker
and
sell
all
your
stocks
.

That
's
the
advice
of
most
investment
professionals
after
Friday
's
190-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

No
one
can
say
for
sure

what
will
happen
today
.

And
investment
pros
are
divided
on
whether
stocks
will
perform
well
or
badly
in
the
next
six
months
.

But
they
're
nearly
unanimous
on
one
point
:
Do
n't
sell
into
a
panic
.

Investors

who
sold
everything
after
the
crash
of
1987
lived
to
regret
it
.

Even
after
Friday
's
plunge
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
was
48
%
above
where
it
landed
on
Oct.
19
two
years
ago
.

Panic
selling
also
was
unwise
during
other
big
declines
in
the
past
.

The
crash
of
1929
was
followed
by
a
substantial
recovery
before
the
great
Depression
and
awful
bear
market
of
the
1930s
began
.

The
``
October
massacres
''
of
1978
and
1979
were
scary
,
but
did
n't
lead
to
severe
or
sustained
downturns
.

Indeed
,
some
pros
see
Friday
's
plunge
,
plus
any
further
damage

that
might
occur
early
this
week
,
as
a
chance
for
bargain
hunting
.

``
There
has
been
a
lot
of
emotional
selling

that
presents
a
nice
buying
opportunity
if
you
've
got
the
cash
,
''
says
Stephen
B.
Timbers
,
chief
investment
officer
of
Chicago-based
Kemper
Financial
Services
Inc
.

But
most
advisers
think
the
immediate
course
for
individual
investors
should
be
to
stand
pat
.

``
When
you
see
a
runaway
train
,
''
says
Steve
Janachowski
,
partner
in
the
San
Francisco
investment
advisory
firm
Brouwer
&
Janachowski
,
``
you
wait
for
the
train
to
stop
.

''

Even
for
people

who
expect
a
bear
market
in
coming
months
--
and
a
sizable
number
of
money
managers
and
market
pundits
do
--
the
advice
is
:
Wait
for
the
market
to
bounce
back
,
and
sell
shares
gradually
during
rallies
.

The
best
thing
individual
investors
can
do
is
``
just
sit
tight
,
''
says
Marshall
B.
Front
,
executive
vice
president
and
head
of
investment
counseling
at
Stein
Roe
&
Farnham
Inc.
,
a
Chicago-based
investment
counseling
firm

that
manages
about
$
18
billion
.

On
the
one
hand
,
Mr.
Front
says
,
it
would
be
misguided
to
sell
into
``
a
classic
panic
.

''
On
the
other
hand
,
it
's
not
necessarily
a
good
time
to
jump
in
and
buy
.

``
This
is
all
emotion
right
now
,
and
when
emotion
starts
to
run
,
it
can
run
further
than
anyone
anticipates
,
''
he
said
.

``
So
it
's
more
prudent
to
wait
and
see
how
things
stabilize
.

''

Roger
Ibbotson
,
professor
of
finance
at
Yale
University
and
head
of
the
market
information
firm
Ibbotson
Associates
Inc.
,
says
,
``
My
real
advice
would
be
to
just
ride
through
it
.

Generally
,
it
is
n't
wise
to
be
in
and
out
''
of
the
stock
market
.

Mr.
Ibbotson
thinks
that
this
week
is
``
going
to
be
a
roller-coaster
week
.

''
But
he
also
thinks
it
is
``
a
good
week
to
consider
buying
.

John
Snyder
,
former

of
the
Los
Angeles
chapter
of
the
National
Association
of
Investors
Corp.
,
an
organization
of
investment
clubs
and
individual
investors
,
says
his
fellow
club
members
did
n't
sell
in
the
crash
of
1987
,
and
see
no
reason
to
sell
now
.

``
We
're
dedicated
long-term
investors
,
not
traders
,
''
he
says
.

``
We
understand
panics
and
euphoria
.

And
we
hope
to
take
advantage
of
panics
and
buy
stocks
when
they
plunge
.

''

One
camp
of
investment
pros
sees
what
happened
Friday
as
an
opportunity
.

Over
the
next
days
and
weeks
,
they
say
,
investors
should
look
for
stocks
to
buy
.

Friday
's
action
``
was
an
old-fashioned
panic
,
''
says
Alfred
Goldman
,
director
of
technical
market
analysis
for
A.G.
Edwards
&
Sons
in
St.
Louis
.

``
Stocks
were
being
thrown
out
of
windows
at
any
price
.

''
His
advice
:
``
You
ought
to
be
there
with
a
basket
catching
them
.

''

James
Craig
,
portfolio
manager
for
the
Denver-based
Janus
Fund
,
which
has
one
of
the
industry
's
better
track
records
,
started
his
buying
during
Friday
's
plunge
.

Stocks
such
as
Hershey
Foods
Corp.
,
Wal-Mart
Stores
Inc.
,
American
International
Group
Inc.
and
Federal
National
Mortgage
Association
became
such
bargains
that
he
could
n't
resist
them
,
he
says
.

And
Mr.
Craig
expects
to
pick
up
more
shares
today
.

``
It
will
be
chaotic
at
first
,
but
I
would
not
be
buying
if
I
thought
we
were
headed
for
real
trouble
,
''
he
says
.

He
argues
that
stocks
are
reasonably
valued
now
,
and
that
interest
rates
are
lower
now
than
in
the
fall
of
1987
.

Mr.
Front
of
Stein
Roe
suggests
that
any
buying
should
``
concentrate
in
stocks

that
have
lagged
the
market
on
the
up
side
,
or
stocks

that
have
been
beaten
down
a
lot
more
than
the
market
in
this
correction
.

''
His
firm
favors
selected
computer
,
drug
and
pollution-control
stocks
.

Other
investment
pros
are
more
pessimistic
.

They
say
investors
should
sell
stocks
--
but
not
necessarily
right
away
.

Many
of
them

stress
that
the
selling
can
be
orderly
,
gradual
,
and
done
when
stock
prices
are
rallying
.

On
Thursday
,
William
Fleckenstein
,
a
Seattle
money
manager
,
used
futures
contracts
in
his
personal
account
to
place
a
bet
that
the
broad
market
averages
would
decline
.

He
thinks
the
underlying
inflation
rate
is
around
5
%
to
6
%
,
far
higher
than
most
people
suppose
.

In
the
pension
accounts
he
manages
,
Mr.
Fleckenstein
has
raised
cash
positions
and
invested
in
gold
and
natural
gas
stocks
,
partly
as
an
inflation
hedge
.

He
thinks
government
officials
are
terrified
to
let
a
recession
start
when
government
,
corporate
and
personal
debt
levels
are
so
high
.

So
he
thinks
the
government
will
err
on
the
side
of
rekindled
inflation
.

As
a
result
,
Mr.
Fleckenstein
says
,
``
I
think
the
ball
game
's
over
,
''
and
investors
are
about
to
face
a
bear
market
.

David
M.
Jones
,
vice
president
at
Aubrey
G.
Lanston
&
Co.
,
recommends
Treasury
securities
(
of
up
to
five
years
'
maturity
)
.

He
says
the
Oct.
6
employment
report
,
showing
slower
economic
growth
and
a
severe
weakening
in
the
manufacturing
sector
,
is
a
warning
sign
to
investors
.

One
strategy
for
investors

who
want
to
stay
in
but
hedge
their
bets
is
to
buy
``
put
''
options
,
either
on
the
individual
stocks
they
own
or
on
a
broad
market
index
.

A
put
option
gives
its
holder

the
right

(
but
not
the
obligation
)
to
sell
a
stock
(
or
stock
index
)
for
a
specified
price
(
the
strike
price
)
until
the
option
expires
.

Whether
this
insurance
is
worthwhile
depends
on
the
cost
of
an
option
.

The
cost
,
or
premium
,
tends
to
get
fat
in
times
of
crisis
.

Thus
,
buying
puts
after
a
big
market
slide
can
be
an
expensive
way
to
hedge
against
risk
.

The
prices
of
puts
generally
did
n't
soar
Friday
.

For
example
,
the
premium
as
a
percentage
of
the
stock
price
for
certain
puts
on
Eli
Lilly
&
Co.
moved
up
from
3
%
at
Thursday
's
close
to
only
3.3
%
at
Friday
's
close
,
even
though
the
shares
dropped
more
than
$
5.50
.

But
put-option
prices
may
zoom
when
trading
resumes
today
.

It
's
hard
to
generalize
about
a
reasonable
price
for
puts
.

But
investors
should
keep
in
mind
,
before
paying
too
much
,
that
the
average
annual
return
for
stock
holdings
,
long-term
,
is
9
%
to
10
%

a
year
;
a
return
of
15
%
is
considered
praiseworthy
.

Paying
,
say
,
10
%
for
insurance
against
losses
takes
a
deep
bite
out
of
the
return
.

As
India
gears
up
for
general
elections
to
be
held
by
January
,
television
is
emerging
as
a
powerful
political
tool
--
and
a
highly
controversial
one
.

Television
is
beamed
into
74
%
of
the
country
's
villages
,
up
from
49
%
during
the
1984
general-election
campaign
.

The
government
hopes
to
get
broadcasts
into
all
of
India
's
57,500
villages
eventually
.

But
the
government
is
essentially
the
only
broadcaster
.

It
controls
the
sole
national
TV
network
,
Doordarshan
,
and
the
only
national
radio
system
,
All
India
Radio
.

TV
news
coverage
has
generally
favored
the
government
.

In
recent
months
,
however
,
critics
say
the
coverage
has
been
so
biased
toward
Prime
Minister
Rajiv
Gandhi
and
his
ruling
Congress
(
I
)
Party
that
what
is
labeled
news
is
merely
propaganda
.

With
the
elections
approaching
,
critics
say
the
manipulation
of
such
an
influential
medium
poses
a
threat
to
India
's
democratic
traditions
.

``
In
a
country
with
our
measure
of
literacy
,
television
is
becoming
a
serious
impediment
in
the
way
of
free
and
fair
elections
,
''
says
Lal
Krishna
Advani
,
an
opposition-party
leader
and
a
former
minister
of
information
and
broadcasting
.

``
It
tilts
the
balance
totally
in
favor
of
the
ruling
party
.

''

But
Kamal
Kant
Tewary
,
minister
for
information
and
broadcasting
,
says
:
``
We
are
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
,
and
we
will
do
whatever

we
think
is
fit
and
in
the
interests
of
the
people
.

''

There
is
general
agreement
on
one
point
:
The
elections
are
likely
to
be
the
most
uncertain
since
1967
.

Many
say
Mr.
Gandhi
and
Congress
(
I
)
,
with
seesawing
popularity
and
an
arms
scandal

that
has
tarnished
the
government
,
stand
a
chance
of
losing
power
.

The
arms
scandal
involves
a
report
by
India
's
comptroller
and
auditor
general
,
which
cited
lapses
in
the
government
's
evaluation
and
purchase
of
artillery
guns
from
a
Swedish
arms
company
.

Television
came
to
India
in
1965
,
when
black-and-white
broadcasts
began
in
New
Delhi
.

Broadcasts
to
other
cities
did
n't
start
until
1972
,
and
color
broadcasts
debuted
just
seven
years
ago
.

In
1980
,
the
country
had
1.6
million
TV
sets
;
today

there
are
20
million
.

That
's
a
small
number
for
a
nation
of
800
million
people
,
but
a
single
set
might
have
much
of
a
village
for
its
audience
.

A
sizable
portion
of
illiterate
Indians
now
rely
on
television
for
news

they
used
to
hear
third
or
fourth
hand
,
if
at
all
.

Doordarshan
is
controlled
by
the
Ministry
of
Information
and
Broadcasting
and
often
takes
orders
directly
from
the
prime
minister
's
office
,
some
Doordarshan
staff
members
contend
.

According
to
critics
,
the
shift
in
Doordarshan
's
news
coverage
from
generally
favoring
the
government
to
outright
bias
began
in
May
.

From
around
that
time
,
the
critics
say
,
items
on
Mr.
Gandhi
and
Congress
(
I
)
have
increasingly
dominated
the
nationwide
evening
news
and
have
been
overwhelmingly
positive
,
while
the
opposition
has
been
given
short
shrift
or
blatantly
abused
.

In
May
,
a
Doordarshan
news
bulletin
quoted
excerpts
from
a
newspaper
article
by
an
opposition
leader
.

The
article
criticized
both

the
government
and
the
opposition
,
but
Doordarshan
aired
only
the
parts
criticizing
the
opposition
.

This
was
merely
news
judgment
,
says
Mr.
Tewary
,
the
information
and
broadcasting
minister
.

In
the
same
month
,
a
group
of
politicians
circulated
a
photo
of
a
top
opposition
leader
,
Ajit
Singh
,
socializing
with
an
alleged
drug
smuggler
.

Newspapers
carried
the
photo
on
their
front
pages
.

Doordarshan
showed
it
on
the
nationwide
news
broadcast
.

The
next
day
,
a
different
group
of
politicians
produced
a
photo
of
Mr.
Gandhi
standing
next
to
the
same
alleged
drug
smuggler
.

Newspapers
again
gave
it
front-page
play
.

Doordarshan
ignored
it
.

Mr.
Tewary
says
the
prime
minister
is
photographed
with
many
people
and
that
therefore
the
photograph
was
n't
news
.

But
a
senior
reporter
at
All
India
Radio
,
who
declines
to
be
identified
,
says
:
``
We
get
orders
from
a
chain
of
people
.

We
are
a
government
news
agency
and
are
expected
to
project
the
government
.

''

For
all
the
criticism
of
what
is
seen
as
government
propaganda
,
many
media
experts
say
it
could
be
counterproductive
.

Says
Probhat
Chandra
Chatterji
,
one
of
the
pioneers
of
Indian
broadcasting
and
a
former
director-general
of
All
India
Radio
and
Doordarshan
:
``
It
is
debatable
whether
this
propaganda
will
bring
votes
to
the
government
.

By
and
large
,
people
think
that
it
will
turn
the
people
away
.

American
Physicians
Service
Group
Inc.
said
it
purchased
about
42
%
of
Prime
Medical
Services
Inc.
for
about
$
5
million
from
Texas
American
Energy
Corp
.

American
Physicians
said
it
also
replaced
four
Texas
American
representatives
on
Prime

's
five-member
board
.

American
provides
a
variety
of
financial
services
to
doctors
and
hospitals
.

Prime
,
based
in
Bedminster
,
N.J.
,
provides
management
services
to
cardiac
rehabilitation
clinics
and
diagnostic
imaging
centers
.

For
the
year
ended
June
30
,
Prime
had
a
net
loss
of
$
3
million
on
sales
of
$
13.8
million
.

Major
steel
companies
,
stung
by
soft
demand
from
car
makers
and
eroding
prices
,
are
expected
to
report
that
third-quarter
operating
profits
plummeted
to
possibly
the
lowest
levels
in
two
years
.

``
This
will
be
the
worst
quarter
since
the
third
quarter
of
1987
,
when
steel
companies
were
just
on
their
way
up
,
''
predicted
John
Tumazos
,
an
analyst
with
Donaldson
,
Lufkin
&
Jenrette
Securities
Corp
.

The
fourth
quarter
could
be
even
more
dismal
.

``
We
are
in
the
midst
of
a
very
severe
price
drop

that
will
really
hit
in
the
fourth
quarter
,
''
said
Peter
Marcus
,
an
analyst
with
PaineWebber
Inc
.

A
rebound
in
those
prices
is
expected
sometime
after
the
winter
of
1990
.

After
enjoying
a
24-month
honeymoon
of
full
production
,
rising
prices
and
lower
costs
,
steelmakers
are
facing
declining
volume
from
disappointing
automotive
,
appliance
and
even
capital
goods
markets
.

The
consensus
is
that
major
steelmakers
earned
between
$
30
and
$
35
for
each
ton
of
steel
shipped
,
compared
with
$
49
in
last
year
's
third
quarter
.

The
latest
quarter
is
also
down
from
the
$
51

a
ton
earned
in
the
second
quarter
,
when
the
industry
benefited
from
modest
price
increases
and
lower
raw
material
costs
.

Mr.
Marcus
expects
fourth-quarter
profits
to
drop
to
about
$
25

a
ton
.

Along
with
lackluster
sales
to
car
makers
--
their
largest
customer
--
steelmakers
are
losing
shipments
to
their
second
largest
customer
,
steel
service
centers
,
which
are
trying
to
reduce
inventories
.

The
Steel
Service
Center
Institute
reported
in
September
that
72
%
of
its
members
believe
inventories
were
``
too
high
,
''
with
65
%
planning
to
reduce
those
levels
during
the
next
six
months
.

Christopher
Plummer
,
an
analyst
with
WEFA
Group
,
noted
that
the
capital
goods
market
,
which
had
been
stronger
than
automotive
and
appliance
markets
,
is
showing
signs
of
weakness
as
well
.

Companies
,
concerned
about
the
economy
and
trying
to
slash
their
own
costs
,
are
backing
off
capital
improvement
programs
,
he
said
.

Overall
,
second-half
steel
shipments
are
expected
to
drop
about
15
%
to
36
million
or
37
million
tons
,
which
some
analysts
say
could
cost
the
industry
$
700
million
in
lost
income
.

Two
companies
,
in
particular
,
were
hurt
by
unusual
events
in
the
third
quarter
.

Bethlehem
Steel
Corp.
,
the
nation
's
second
largest
steelmaker
,
was
hampered
by
wildcat
coal
strikes
,
a
spot
strike
at
its
freight
car
operation
and
blast
furnace
problems
at
its
crown
jewel
Sparrows
Point
plant
.

Charles
Bradford
,
an
analyst
with
Merrill
Lynch
Capital
Markets
,
predicts
Bethlehem
earnings
dropped
more
than
two-thirds
to
about
50
cents

a
share
,
from
$
2.35

a
year
ago
,
excluding
major
nonrecurring
items
.

National
Steel
Corp.
,
the
nation
's
sixth
largest
steel
company
,
predicted
at
the
beginning
of
1989
that
the
third
quarter
would
be
its
best
.

However
,
an
initial
rejection
by
steelworkers
of
a
new
labor
accord
sent
nervous
National
Steel
customers
scrambling
for
alternative
suppliers
.

Moreover
,
National
Steel
is
tied
closely
to
the
sluggish
automobile
industry
.

One
other
factor
for
some
steelmakers
:
higher
costs
associated
with
new
labor
contracts
.

Inland
Steel
Industries
Inc.
,
which
recently
negotiated
an
accord

that
calls
for
immediate
and
significant
wage
increases
,
is
expected
to
see
earnings
drop
to
less
than
$
1

a
share
from
$
1.70

a
year
earlier
because
of
the
pact
,
as
well
as
disappointments
in
its
steel
service
center
operations
.

About
the
only
major
steelmaker
expected
to
post
improved
results
is
USX
Corp.
,
which
once
again
will
post
gains
from
asset
sales
.

Many
analysts
initially
raised
earnings
forecasts
for
the
nation
's
largest
steelmaker
as
a
result
of
the
coming
sale
of
reserves
from
its
Texas
Oil
&
Gas
unit
.

The
expected
$
1
billion-plus
proceeds
are
expected
to
be
used
to
reduce
debt
and
buy
back
shares
.

One
wild
card
in
USX
's
future
earnings
is
investor
Carl
Icahn
,
who
boosted
his
stake
in
USX
and
is
urging
more
restructuring
.

Recent
order
rates
indicate
that
the
fourth
quarter
,
a
time
shipments
usually
pick
up
,
will
be
weak
as
well
.

Merrill
Lynch
's
Mr.
Bradford
said
,
``
We
have
n't
seen
the
pickup
in
flat
rolled
orders
that
we
should
have
.

''
Flat
rolled
steel
is
the
industry
's
major
product
.

Typically
,
steelmakers
would
look
to
the
export
market
to
unload
excess
capacity
.

But
that
market
is
hurting
as
well
.

PaineWebber
noted
that
the
world
steel
export
price
of
cold-rolled
steel
has
dropped
to
$
460
to
$
480

a
metric
ton
from
a
high
of
$
560
this
spring
.

Moreover
,
the
relative
strength
of
the
dollar
and
lower
world
prices
may
result
in
increased
sales
in
the
U.S.
by
foreign
producers
offering
lower
prices
.

There
are
some
bright
spots
for
the
industry
.

The
service
center
association
reports
that
shipments
were
up
in
August
,
indicating
a
resurgence
in
demand
for
carbon
flat
rolled
and
stainless
steel
products
.

John
Jacobson
,
an
analyst
with
AUS
Consultants
,
also
said
he
believes
steel
production
costs
are
coming
down
because
of
increased
efficiencies
at
major
mills
.

Recognition
Equipment
Inc.
said
it
settled
a
civil
action
filed
against
it
by
the
federal
government
on
behalf
of
the
U.S.
Postal
Service
.

The
government
sued
the
company
in
April
,
seeking
$
23,000
and
other
unspecified
damages
related
to
an
alleged
contract-steering
scheme
.

The
suit
named
the
company
,
former
chief
executive
officer
William
G.
Moore
Jr.
,
former
vice
president
Robert
W.
Reedy
and
five
defendants

who
were
n't
part
of
the
company
.

The
suit
charged
the
defendants
with
causing
Peter
E.
Voss
,
an
ex-member
of
the
Postal
Service
board
of
governors
,
to
accept
$
23,000
in
bribes
,
kickbacks
and
gratuities
.

Mr.
Voss
was
previously
sentenced
to
four
years
in
prison
and
fined
$
11,000
for
his
role
in
the
scheme
.

In
the
agreement
,
Recognition
agreed
to
pay
the
government
$
20,000
in
return
for
the
release
of
all
claims
against
the
company
,
Mr.
Moore
and
Mr.
Reedy
.

The
five
additional
defendants
were
n't
parties
to
the
settlement
.

A
trial
on
criminal
allegations
against
the
company
and
the
same
two
former
executives
began
Sept.
27
in
federal
court
for
the
District
of
Columbia
.

They
were
indicted
last
October
on
charges
of
fraud
,
theft
and
conspiracy
related
to
an
effort
to
win
$
400
million
in
Postal
Service
equipment
contracts
by
the
maker
of
data
management
equipment
.

The
company
and
its
executives
deny
the
charges
.

In
a
related
development
,
Recognition
Equipment
said
the
Postal
Service
has
barred
the
company
from
bidding
on
postal
contracts
for
an
additional
120
days
.

The
Postal
Service
originally
suspended
the
company
Oct.
7
,
1988
,
and
has
been
renewing
the
ban
ever
since
.

The
company
said
it
will
continue
to
pursue
a
lifting
of
the
suspension
.

Intel
Corp.
reported
a
50
%
drop
in
third-quarter
net
income
,
partly
because
of
a
one-time
charge
for
discontinued
operations
.

The
big
semiconductor
and
computer
maker
,
said
it
had
net
of
$
72
million
,
or
38
cents
,
down
50
%
from
$
142.7
million
,
or
78
cents

a
share
.

The
lower
net
included
a
charge
of
$
35
million
,
equal
to
12
cents

a
share
on
an
after-tax
basis
,
for
the
cost
of
abandoning
a
computer-systems
joint
venture
with
Siemens
AG
of
West
Germany
.

Earning
also
fell
from
the
year-ago
period
because
of
slowing
microchip
demand
.

Sales
amounted
to
$
771.4
million
,
down
1.7
%
from
$
784.9
million
.

Intel
's
stock
rose
in
early
over-the-counter
trading
Friday
,
as
investors
appeared
relieved
that
the
company
's
income
from
continuing
operations
was
only
slightly
below
the
second
quarter
's
earnings
of
$
99.3
million
,
or
53
cents

a
share
,
and
that
sales
actually
exceeded
the
$
747.3
million
for
the
second
period
.

But
Intel
later
succumbed
to
the
stock
market
's
plunge
,
closing
at
$
31.75
,
down
$
2.125
.

In
August
,
Intel
warned
that
third-quarter
earnings
might
be
``
flat
to
down
''
from
the
previous
period
's
because
of
slowing
sales
growth
of
its
80386
microprocessor
,
start-up
costs
associated
with
a
line
of
computers
and
costs
of
preparing
for
mass
shipments
of
the
company
's
new
80486
chip
in
the
current
quarter
.

On
Friday
,
Andrew
S.Grove
,
Intel
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
said
``
Intel
's
business
is
strong
.

Our
bookings
improved
as
the
quarter
progressed
and
September
was
especially
good
.

For
the
full
quarter
,
our
bookings
were
higher
than
the
previous
quarter
,
and
our
book-to-bill
ratio
exceeded
1.0
.

''

For
the
nine-month
period
,
Intel
reported
net
of
$
268.3
million
,
or
$
1.43

a
share
,
down
27
%
from
$
367.1
million
,
or
$
2.05

a
share
.

Revenue
amounted
to
$
2.23
billion
,
up
slightly
from
$
2.15
billion
.

First
Chicago
Corp.
posted
a
third-quarter
loss
of
$
23.3
million
after
joining
other
big
banks
in
further
adding
to
its
reserves
for
losses
on
foreign
loans
.

The
parent
company
of
First
National
Bank
of
Chicago
,
with
$
48
billion
in
assets
,
said
it
set
aside
$
200
million
to
absorb
losses
on
loans
and
investments
in
financially
troubled
countries
.

The
addition
,
on
top
of
two
big
1987
additions
to
foreign-loan
reserves
,
brings
the
reserve
to
a
level
equaling
79
%
of
medium-term
and
long-term
loans
outstanding
to
troubled
nations
.

First
Chicago
since
1987
has
reduced
its
loans
to
such
nations
to
$
1.7
billion
from
$
3
billion
.

Despite
this
loss
,
First
Chicago
said
it
does
n't
need
to
sell
stock
to
raise
capital
.

During
the
quarter
,
the
company
realized
a
pretax
gain
of
$
60.4
million
from
the
sale
of
its
First
Chicago
Investment
Advisors
unit
.

Combined
foreign
exchange
and
bond
trading
profits
dipped
24
%
against
last
year
's
third
quarter
,
to
$
38.2
million
from
$
50.5
million
.

Gains
from
First
Chicago
's
venture
capital
unit
,
a
big
leveraged
buy-out
investor
,
rose
32
%
to
$
34
million
from
$
25.7
million

a
year
ago
.

Interest
income
and
most
fee
income
was
strong
.

Friday
's
190-point
plunge
in
stocks
does
not
come
atop
the
climate
of
anxiety

that
dominated
financial
markets
just
prior
to
their
1987
October
crash
,
and
mechanisms
have
been
put
in
place
to
keep
markets
more
orderly
.

Still
,
the
lesson
is
about
the
same
:
On
Friday

the
13th
,
the
market
was
spooked
by
Washington
.

The
consensus
along
the
street
seems
to
be
that
the
plunge
was
triggered
by
the
financing
problems
of
the
UAL
takeover
,
and
it
's
certainly
true
the
rout
began
immediately
after
the
UAL
trading
halt
.

Still
,
the
consensus
seems
almost
as
wide
that
one
faltering
bid
is
no
reason
to
write
down
the
value
of
all
U.S.
business
.

This
observation
leads
us
to
another
piece
of
news
moving
on
the
Dow
Jones
ticker
shortly
before
the
downturn
:
the
success
of
Senate
Democrats
in
stalling
the
capital
gains
tax
cut
.

The
real
value
of
all
shares
,
after
all
,
is
directly
impacted
by
the
tax
on
any
profits
(
all
the
more
so
given
the
limits
on
deductions
for
losses

that
show
gains
are
not
``
ordinary
income
''
)
.

And
market
expectations
clearly
have
been
raised
by
the
capital
gains
victory
in
the
House
last
month
.

An
hour
before
Friday
's
plunge
,
that
provision
was
stripped
from
the
tax
bill
,
leaving
it
with
$
5.4
billion
in
tax
increases
without
a
capital
gains
cut
.

There
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
,
to
be
sure
,
for
stripping
the
garbage
out
of
the
reconciliation
bill
.

It
would
be
a
good
thing
if
Congress
started
to
decide
issues
one-by-one
on
their
individual
merits
without
trickery
.

For
one
thing
,
no
one
doubts
that
the
capital
gains
cut
would
pass
on
an
up-or-down
vote
.

Since
Senate
leaders
have
so
far
fogged
it
up
with
procedural
smokescreens
,
promises
of
a
cleaner
bill
are
suspect
.

Especially
so
since
President
Bush
has
been
weakened
by
the
Panama
fiasco
.

To
the
extent
that
the
UAL
troubles
contributed
to
the
plunge
,
they
are
another
instance
of
Washington
's
sticky
fingers
.

As
the
best
opportunities
for
corporate
restructurings
are
exhausted
of
course
,
at
some
point

the
market
will
start
to
reject
them
.

But
the
airlines
are
scarcely
a
clear
case
,
given
anti-takeover
mischief
by
Secretary
of
Transportation
Skinner
,
who
professes
to
believe
safety
will
be
compromised
if
KLM
and
British
Airways
own
interests
in
companies

that
fly
airplanes
.

Worse
,
Congress
has
started
to
jump
on
the
Skinner
bandwagon
.

James
Oberstar
,
the
Minnesota
Democrat

who
chairs
the
Public
Works
and
Transportation
Committee
's
aviation
subcommittee
,
has
put
an
anti-airline
takeover
bill
on
supersonic
speed
so
that
it
would
be
passed
in
time
to
affect
the
American
and
United
Air
Lines
bids
.

It
would
give
Mr.
Skinner
up
to
50
days
to
``
review
''
any
bid
for
15
%
or
more
of
the
voting
stock
of
any
U.S.
carrier
with
revenues
of
$
1
billion
or
more
.

So
the
UAL
deal
has
problems
,
and
the
market
loses
190
points
.

Congratulations
,
Mr.
Secretary
and
Mr.
Congressman
.

In
the
1987
crash
,
remember
,
the
market
was
shaken
by
a
Danny
Rostenkowski
proposal
to
tax
takeovers
out
of
existance
.

Even
more
important
,
in
our
view
,
was
the
Treasury
's
threat
to
thrash
the
dollar
.

The
Treasury
is
doing
the
same
thing
today
;
thankfully
,
the
dollar
is
not
under
1987-style
pressure
.

Also
,
traders
are
in
better
shape
today
than
in
1987
to
survive
selling
binges
.

They
are
better
capitalized
.

They
are
in
less
danger
of
losing
liquidity
simply
because
of
tape
lags
and
clearing
and
settlement
delays
.

The
Fed
promises
any
needed
liquidity
.

The
Big
Board
's
liaison
with
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
has
improved
;
it
will
be
interesting
to
learn
if
``
circuit
breakers
''
prove
to
be
a
good
idea
.

In
any
event
,
some
traders
see
stocks
as
underpriced
today
,
unlike
1987
.

There
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
market

that
ca
n't
be
cured
by
a
little
coherence
and
common
sense
in
Washington
.

But
on
the
bearish
side
,
that
may
be
too
much
to
expect
.

It

all
seemed
innocent
enough
:
Last
April
,
one
Steven
B.
Iken
visited
Justin
Products
Inc.
here
,
identified
himself
as
a
potential
customer
and
got
the
word
on
the
little
company
's
new
cassette
players
for
children
.

``
It
is
almost
identical
to
the
Sony
product
,
''
Mr.
Iken
remarked
,
after
seeing
prototypes
and
pictures
.

Replied
a
Justin
salesman
:
``
Exactly
.

''
The
Justin
merchandise
carried
wholesale
prices

some
40
%
below
those
of
Sony
Corp.
of
Japan
's
``
My
First
Sony
''
line
.

The
visitor
waxed
enthusiastic
and
promised
to
return
.

But
instead
of
a
new
customer
--
part
of
a
hoped-for
bonanza
from
underselling
Sony
--
Justin
got
a
costly
legal
morass
.

Mr.
Iken
,
it
turned
out
,
was
a
private
detective
using
a
hidden
tape
recorder
to
gather
information
for
Sony
.

His
recording
later
turned
up
as
a
court
exhibit
.

Seeking
to
keep
Justin
's
``
My
Own
''
product
line
off
the
U.S.
market
,
Sony
last
May
filed
a
suit
in
Manhattan
federal
court
accusing
the
upstart
of
trademark
infringement
,
unfair
competition
and
other
violations
of
business
law
.

Since
then
,
life
has
changed
a
lot
for
61-year-old
Leonard
Kaye
,
Justin
's
owner
.

``
I
have
n't
been
able
to
get
a
decent
night
's
sleep
since
this
has
been
going
on
,
''
he
says
.

``
It
's
the
most

distracting
thing
in
my
life
--
I
ca
n't
even
attend
to
my
business
.

''
His
company
(
annual
sales
:
about
$
25
million
)
may
suffer
a
costly
blow
--
losing
an
estimated
10
%
of
total
sales
--
if
Sony
(
annual
sales
:
about
$
16
billion
)
prevails
.

Justin
's
plight
shows
what
can
happen
when
a
tiny
company
suddenly
faces
the
full
legal
might
of
a
wrathful
multinational
.

With
considerable
irony
,
the
case
also
shows
how
completely
Japan
has
turned
the
tables
on
U.S.
business
.

Americans
used
to
complain
bitterly
about
being
undersold
by
look-alike
products
from
Japan
.

Now
Sony
,
whose
innovative
,
premium-priced
products
are
among
the
most
admired
in
consumer
electronics
,
is
bitterly
complaining
about
a
little
U.S.
firm
with
a
cheap
look-alike
produced
in
China
.

``
The
gist
of
this
is
that
Justin
knocked
off
the
Sony
line
and
Sony
wants
to
stop
it
,
''
says
Lewis
H.
Eslinger
,
Sony
's
attorney
,
who
previously
guarded
Rubik
's
Cube
.

(
Sony
itself
declines
to
comment
.

)
If
Sony
wins
,
Mr.
Eslinger
says
,
its
little
rival
will
have
to
try
to
sell
the
products
overseas
.

At
worst
,
he
adds
,
``
They
'd
have
to
grind
them

all
up
and
throw
them
away
.

''

Mr.
Kaye
denies
the
suit
's
charges
and
says
his
only
mistake
was
taking
on
Sony
in
the
marketplace
.

``
I
made
a
similar
line
and
I
produced
it
cheaper
,
''
he
says
.

Today
,
U.S.
Judge
John
E.
Sprizzo
is
expected
to
rule
on
Sony
's
renewed
request
for
a
pre-trial
order
blocking
sale
of
the
disputed
products
,
on
which
deliveries
began
in
July
.

The
judge
turned
down
an
earlier
Sony
request
for
such
an
order
--
a
decision
upheld
on
appeal
--
but
Sony
returned
with
additional
evidence
and
arguments
.

Though
hoping
to
settle
the
case
,
Justin
vows
to
fight
on
,
if
necessary
.

But
the
battle
is
more
than
Justin
bargained
for
.

``
I
had
no
idea

I
was
getting
in
so
deep
,
''
says
Mr.
Kaye
,
who
founded
Justin
in
1982
.

Mr.
Kaye
had
sold
Capetronic
Inc.
,
a
Taiwan
electronics
maker
,
and
retired
,
only
to
find
he
was
bored
.

With
Justin
,
he
began
selling
toys
and
electronics
made
mostly
in
Hong
Kong
,
beginning
with
Mickey
Mouse
radios
.

The
company
has
grown
--
to
about
40
employees
,
from
four
initially
,
Mr.
Kaye
says
.

Justin
has
been
profitable
since
1986
,
adds
the
official
,
who
shares
his
office
with
numerous
teddy
bears
,
all
samples
from
his
line
of
plush
toys
.

Like
many
others
,
Mr.
Kaye
took
notice
in
1987
when
Sony
,
in
a
classic
example
of
market
segmentation
,
changed
the
plastic
skin
and
buttons
on
the
famous
Walkman
line
of
portable
audio
equipment
and
created
the
My
First
Sony
line
for
children
.

The
brightly
colored
new
products
looked
more
like
toys
than
the
adult
models
.

(
In
court
papers
,
Sony
says
it
has
spent
more
than
$
3
million
to
promote
the
line
,
with
resulting
sales
of
over
a
million
units
.

)

Sony
found
a
new
market
niche
,
but
Mr.
Kaye
figured
that
its
prices
left
plenty
of
room
for
a
lower-priced
competitor
.

His
products
are
n't
exact
copies
of
Sony
's
but
strongly
resemble
them
in
size
,
shape
and
,
especially
,
color
.

Sony
uses
mostly
red
and
blue
,
with
traces
of
yellow
--
and
so
does
Justin
,
on
the
theory
that
kids
prefer
these
colors
.

(
``
To
be
successful
,
a
product
can
be
any
color
whatsoever
,
as
long
as
it
is
fire-engine
red
,
''
says
Charles
E.
Baxley
,
Justin
's
attorney
.

)

By
last
winter
,
Justin
was
showing
prototypes
at
toy
fairs
in
Hong
Kong
and
New
York
--
and
Sony
noticed
.

Indeed
,
concerned
that
Sony
sales
personnel
were
threatening
legal
action
or
other
retaliation
--
such
as
withholding
desirable
Sony
products
--
against
Justin
's
customers
,
Mr.
Baxley
fired
off
a
letter
to
Sony
in
April
.

He

himself
threatened
to
take
the
matter
to
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
or
U.S.
Justice
Department
.

But
Justin
has
n't
pursued
those
charges
(
which
were
without
merit
,
according
to
Mr.
Eslinger
,
the
Sony
attorney
)
.

Recalls
Mr.
Baxley
:
``
Our
purpose
was
to
influence
them
to
leave
us
alone
.

We
never
intended
taking
on
Sony
--
we
do
n't
have
the
resources
.

''

Sony
answered
the
empty
threat
with
its
real
suit
.

Off
and
on
since
then
,
the
companies
have
skirmished
in
court
.

And
Justin
,
in
a
news
release
,
says
,
``
Once
competitive
,
Sony
now
resorts
to
strong-arm
tactics
in
American
courtrooms
to
carve
out
and
protect
niche
markets
.

''

Sony
's
lawyer
insists
that
the
company
's
tactics
--
including
the
use
of
a
private
detective
posing
as
a
buyer
--
are
routine
in
such
matters
.

He
also
insists
that
Sony
,
no
less
than
others
,
has
a
legal
right
to
protect
its
``
trade
dress
,
''
in
this
case
,
mostly
the
colors
that
it
claims
make
My
First
Sony
products
distinctive
.

(
Justin
claims

it
began
using
the
same
colors
on
electronic
goods
for
children
long
before
Sony
entered
the
children
's
market
.

)

Whatever

its
merits
,
Sony
's
aggressive
defense
is
debilitating
for
Justin
.

It
's
also
costly
.

Mr.
Kaye
says
he
has
paid
more
than
$
70,000
in
legal
fees
so
far
.

Of
Sony
,
Mr.
Kaye
says
:
``
They
know
there
's
no
way
for
them
to
lose
.

They
just
keep
digging
me
in
deeper
until
I
reach
the
point
where
I
give
up
and
go
away
.

''
For
now
,
though
,
he
vows
to
hang
in
.

Mexican
investor
Joel
Rocha
Garza
said
he
sold
a
block
of
600,000
shares
of
Smith
Laboratories
Inc.
common
stock
to
companies
affiliated
with
him
.

In
a
filing
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
,
Mr.
Rocha
Garza
said
Biscayne
Syndicate
Inc.
,
Lahus
II
Inc.
,
and
Lahus
III
Inc.
bought
the
600,000
shares
on
Oct.
11
for
$
1.4
million
,
or
$
2.375

a
share
.

Mr.
Rocha
Garza
said
that
he
,
Clarendon
Group
Ltd.
,
Biscayne
,
Lahus
II
,
and
Lahus
III
are
all
affiliated
and
hold
a
combined
stake
of
1,234,100
shares
,
or
9.33
%
.

Mr.
Rocha
Garza
has
said
he
wants
to
purchase
more
shares
.

In
San
Diego
,
Smith
Laboratories
President
Timothy
Wollaeger
said
the
transfer
of
the
shares
is
n't
significant
.

Matra
Communications
S.A.
,
a
unit
of
France
's
defense
and
electronics
group
,
Matra
S.A.
,
said
it
expects
strong
profit
growth
in
both

1989
and
1990
.

The
company
,
which
is
preparing
to
sell
10
%
of
its
shares
on
the
French
stock
market
,
said
profit
could
reach
between
100
million
francs
(
$
15.4
million
)
and
110
million
francs

this
year
,
representing
increases
of
between
30
%
and
44
%
from
the
1988
level
of
76.5
million
francs
.

For
1990
,
profit
growth
could
slow
to
between
18
%
and
20
%
,
reaching
between
120
million
and
130
million
francs
,
the
company
said
.

The
company
plans
to

Greece
's
second
bout
of
general
elections

this
year
is
slated
for
Nov.
5
.

For
those
hoping
to
see
a
modicum
of
political
normalcy
restored
--
in
view
of
Greece
's
eight-year
misadventure
under
autocratic
pseudosocialism
and
subsequent
three-month
hitch
with
a
conservative-communist
coalition
government
--
there
is
but
one
bright
sign
:
The
scandals
still
encircling
former
Prime
Minister
Andreas
Papandreou
and
his
fallen
socialist
government
are
like
flies
buzzing
around
a
rotting
carcass
.

In
the
mid-June
round
of
voting
,
Greeks
gave
no
clear
mandate
to
any
single
political
party
.

The
ad
interim
coalition
government

that
emerged
from
post-electoral
hagglings
was
,
in
essence
,
little
more
than
the
ill-conceived
offspring
of
ideological
miscegenation
:
On
one
side
,
the
center-right
New
Democracy
Party
,
headed
by
Constantine
Mitsotakis
.

On
the
other
,
the
so-called
Coalition
of
the
Left
and
Progress
--
a
quaint
and
rather
deceptive
title
for
a
merger
of
the
pro-Soviet
Communist
Party
of
Greece
and
its
Euro-Communist
cousin
,
the
Hellenic
Left
.

The
unifying
bond
for
this
left-right
mismatch
was
plain
:
PASOK
(
Mr.
Papandreou
's
party
)
as
common
political
enemy
.

The
ostensible
goal
was
a
mop-up
of
government
corruption
,
purportedly
at
all
levels
,
but
the
main
marks
were
Mr.
Papandreou
and
his
closest
associates
.

In
point
of
fact
,
this
catharsis
was
overdue
by
decades
.

When
reduced
to
buzzword
status
in
ex
parte
pledges
,
however
,
the
notion
transmogrified
into
a
promised
assault
,
with
targets
primarily
for
political
gains
,
not
justice
.

With
regard
to
Greece
's
long-bubbling
bank-looting
scandal
,
Mr.
Papandreou
's
principal
accuser
remains
George
Koskotas
,
former
owner
of
the
Bank
of
Crete
and
self-confessed
embezzler
,
now
residing
in
a
jail
cell
in
Salem
,
Mass.
,
from
where
he
is
fighting
extradition
proceedings

that
would
return
him
to
Greece
.

Mr.
Koskotas
's
credibility
is
,
at
best
,
problematic
.

He
has
ample
motive
to
shift
the
blame
,
and
his
testimony
has
also
been
found
less
than
forthright
on
numerous
points
.

Nevertheless
,
the
New
Democracy
and
Communist
parties
herald
his
assertions
as
proof
of
PASOK
complicity
.

Among
unanswered
questions
are
whether
Mr.
Papandreou
received
$
23
million
of
stolen
Bank
of
Crete
funds
and
an
additional
$
734,000
in
bribes
,
as
contended
;
whether
the
prime
minister
ordered
state
agencies
to
deposit
some
$
57
million
in
Mr.
Koskotas
's
bank
and
then
skim
off
the
interest
;
and
,
what

PASOK
's
cut
was
from
the
$
210
million
Mr.
Koskotas
pinched
.

Two
former
ministers
were
so
heavily
implicated
in
the
Koskotas
affair
that
PASOK
members
of
Parliament
voted
to
refer
them
to
the
special
court
.

But
eluding
parliamentary
probe
was
the
case
of
millions
of
drachmas
Mr.
Koskotas
funneled
into
New
Democracy
coffers
.

In
the
end
,
the
investigation
produced
only
circumstantial
evidence
and
``
indications
''
that
point
to
PASOK
,
not
clinching
proof
.

On
another
issue
,
Greeks
were
told
how
their
national
intelligence
agency
,
the
EYP
,
regularly
monitored
the
telephone
conversations
of
prominent
figures
,
including
key
opposition
politicians
,
journalists
and
PASOK
cabinet
members
.

Despite
convincing
arguments
,
it
was
never
established
that
Mr.
Papandreou
personally
ordered
or
directed
the
wiretaps
.

The
central
weakness
of
the
``
scandals
''
debates
was
pointed
up
especially
well
when
discussions
focused
on
arms
deals
and
kickbacks
.

The
coalition
government
tried
to
show
that
PASOK
ministers
had
received
hefty
sums
for
OKing
the
purchase
of
F-16
Fighting
Falcon
and
Mirage
2000
combat
aircraft
,
produced
by
the
U.S.based
General
Dynamics
Corp.
and
France
's
Avions
Marcel
Dassault
,
respectively
.

Naturally
,
neither
General
Dynamics
nor
Dassault
could
be
expected
to
hamper
its
prospective
future
dealings
by
making
disclosures
of
sums
paid
(
or
not
)
to
various
Greek
officials
for
services
rendered
.

So
it
seems
that
Mr.
Mitsotakis
and
his
communist
chums
may
have
unwittingly
served
Mr.
Papandreou

a
moral
victory
on
a
platter
:
PASOK
,
whether
guilty
or
not
,
can
now
traipse
the
countryside
condemning
the
whole
affair
as
a
witch
hunt
at
Mr.
Papandreou
's
expense
.

But
while
verbal
high
jinks
alone
wo
n't
help
PASOK
regain
power
,
Mr.
Papandreou
should
never
be
underestimated
.

First
came
his
predictable
fusillade
:
He
charged
the
Coalition
of
the
Left
and
Progress
had
sold
out
its
leftist
tenets
by
collaborating
in
a
right-wing
plot
aimed
at
ousting
PASOK
and
thwarting
the
course
of
socialism
in
Greece
.

Then
,
to
buttress
his
credibility
with
the
left
,
he
enticed
some
smaller
leftist
parties
to
stand
for
election
under
the
PASOK
banner
.

Next
,
he
continued
to
court
the
communists
--
many
of
whom
feel
betrayed
by
the
left-right
coalition
's
birth
--
by
bringing
into
PASOK

a
well-respected
Communist
Party
candidate
.

For
balance
,
and
in
hopes
of
gaining
some
disaffected
centrist
votes
,
he
managed
to
attract
a
former
New
Democracy
Party
representative
and
known
political
enemy
of
Mr.
Mitsotakis
.

Thus
PASOK
heads
for
the
polls
not
only
with
diminished
scandal-stench
,
but
also
with
``
seals
of
approval
''
from
representatives
of
its
harshest
accusers
.

Crucial
as
these
elections
are
for
Greece
,
pressing
issues
of
state
are
getting
lost
in
the
shuffle
.

The
country
's
future
NATO
participation
remains
unsure
,
for
instance
.

Greece
also
must
revamp
major
pieces
of
legislation
in
preparation
for
the
1992
targets
of
heightened
Common
Market
cooperation
.

Greece
's
bilateral
relations
with
the
U.S.
need
attention
soon
as
well
.

For
one
,
the
current
accord
concerning
U.S.
military
bases
in
Greece
lapses
in
May
1990
.

Negotiations
for
a
new
agreement
were
frozen
before
the
June
elections
,
but
the
clock
is
running
.

Another
matter
of
concern
is
the
extradition
of
Mohammed
Rashid
,
a
Palestinian
terrorist

who
is
wanted
in
the
U.S.
for
the
1982
bombing
of
a
Pan
American
Airways
flight
.

The
Greek
courts
have
decided
in
favor
of
extradition
in
the
Rashid
case
,
but
the
matter
awaits
final
approval
from
Greece
's
next
justice
minister
.

The
Greeks
seem
barely
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
case
as
a
litmus
test
of
whether
Greece
will
be
counted
in
or
out
for
international
efforts
to
combat
terrorism
.

That
PASOK
could
win
the
elections
outright
is
improbable
;
the
Greek
press
,
previously
eager
to
palm
off
PASOK
's
line
,
has
turned
on
Mr.
Papandreou
with
a
wild-eyed
vengeance
.

Yet
the
possibility
of
another
lash-up
government
is
all
too
real
.

If
Mr.
Papandreou
becomes
the
major
opposition
leader
,
he
could
hamstring
a
conservative-led
coalition
.

Also
,
he
could
force
new
elections
early
next
year
by
frustrating
the
procedures
for
the
election
of
the
president
of
the
republic
in
March
.

New
Democracy
has
once
again
glaringly
underestimated
the
opponent
and
linked
its
own
prospects
to
negative
reaction
against
PASOK
,
forgetting
to
tend
to
either
program
clarity
or
the
rectification
of
internal
squabbles
.

As
for
Mr.
Papandreou
?

He
's
not
exactly
sitting
pretty
at
this
stage
.

But
since
he
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
most
proficient
bull
slingers

who
ever
raked
muck
,
it
seems
far
wiser
to
view
him
as
sidelined
,
but
certainly
not
yet
eliminated
.

Mr.
Carpenter
,
a
regional
correspondent
for
National
Review
,
has
lived
in
Athens
since
1981
.

Trinity
Industries
Inc.
said
it
reached
a
preliminary
agreement
to
manufacture
1,000
coal
rail
cars
for
Norfolk
Southern
Corp
.

Trinity
estimated
the
value
of
the
pact
at
more
than
$
40
million
.

Trinity
said
it
plans
to
begin
delivery
of
the
rail
cars
in
the
first
quarter
of
1990
.

It
said
the
1,000
rail
cars
are
in
addition
to
the
1,450
coal
rail
cars
presently
being
produced
for
Norfolk
Southern
,
a
Norfolk
,
Va.-based
railroad
concern
.

Ronald
J.
Berens
was
elected
to
the
new
post
of
senior
vice
president-U.S.
apparel
group
,
effective
Nov.
1
.

He
will
be
responsible
for
the
apparel
operations
of
the
retailer
's
Holtzman
's
Little
Folk
Shop
Inc.
and
Richman
Brothers
Co.
units
and
the
Susie
's
division
of
its
Kinney
Shoe
Corp.
unit
.

Mr.
Berens
,
50
years
old
,
currently
is
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
Little
Folk
unit
.

Advertising
agencies
'
third-quarter
earnings
are
expected
to
be
up
modestly
from
a
year
ago
,
securities
analysts
say
.

Andrew
Wallach
,
an
analyst
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
,
is
estimating
Interpublic
Group
,
for
example
,
at
21
cents

a
share
,
up
from
18
cents

a
share

a
year
ago
.

Greg
Ostroff
,
an
analyst
at
Goldman
Sachs
,
is
pegging
Omnicom
Group
at
17
cents

a
share
,
up
from
15
cents

a
share
,
and
Foote
,
Cone
&
Belding
Communications
Inc.
at
55
cents

a
share
,
up
from
46
cents
.

Analysts
note
,
however
,
that
the
third
period
is
a
minor
quarter
in
terms
of
absolute
profits
.

Those

who
watch
Madison
Avenue
say
this
period
,
along
with
the
first
quarter
,
is
traditionally
weak
.

The
fourth
quarter
is
where
the
real
impact
is
made
.

``
We
tend
not
to
read
much
into
third-quarter
earnings
,
''
Mr.
Ostroff
says
.

Also
notable
is
the
fact
that
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
Co.
and
WPP
Group
PLC
,
two
British
giants

that
are
principal
players
in
the
advertising
business
,
do
n't
report
quarterly
earnings
.

In
the
industry
overall
,
``
profits
will
increase
unless
revenues
are
disastrously
lower
,
''
said
Alan
Gottesman
,
an
analyst
at
PaineWebber
Inc.
,
New
York
.

``
There
are
no
external
indications
''
to
indicate
that
will
be
the
case
,
he
said
.

Mr.
Gottesman
noted
that
the
employee
count
for
the
industry
is
down
and
that
most
agencies
are
watching
staffing
levels
in
a
bid
to
closely
monitor
costs
.

Others
are
cautiously
watching
the
value
of
the
dollar
overseas
.

``
From
where
I
sit
,
the
biggest
issue
for
the
U.S.
agencies
is
the
dollar
,
''
said
Emma
Hill
,
an
analyst
at
Wertheim
Schroder
&
Co.
,
New
York
.

``
For
the
U.S.
companies
,
the
risk
is
one
of
disappointment
versus
better-than-expected
because
of
the
dollar
.

''
Ad
agencies
rely
heavily
on
business
overseas
for
their
bottom
line
.

The
strength
of
the
dollar
will
hurt
the
reporting
of
foreign
earnings
,
many
analysts
said
.

Some
agencies
,
including
Interpublic
Group
's
Lintas
and
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
's
Backer
Spielvogel
Bates
,
have
said
that
their
clients
are
spending
less
than
they
had
expected
.

Few
agencies
are
reporting
that
their
clients
'
ad
budgets
are
expanding
.

All
eyes
,
however
,
are
on
the
fourth
quarter
and
to
reporting
by
the
giant
British
companies
.

``
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
is
having
a
very
tough
year
,
''
Drexel
Burnham
's
Mr.
Wallach
said
.

``
It
's
real
guesswork
figuring
out
what

they
'll
earn
.

''
That
agency
,
rumored
as
a
takeover
candidate
,
earlier
this
year
said
pretax
profit
for
1989
would
trail
1988
's
already
disappointing
level
.

For
WPP
Group
,
on
the
other
hand
,
most
analysts
are
looking
for
margin
improvement
and
good
results
considering
its
acquisition
earlier
this
year
of
Ogilvy
Group
.

Assuming
the
stock
market
does
n't
crash
again
and
completely
discredit
yuppies
and
trading
rooms
,
American
television
audiences
in
a
few
months
may
be
seeing
Britain
's
concept
of
both
.

``
Capital
City
''
is
a
weekly
series

that
premiered
here
three
weeks
ago
amid
unprecedented
hype
by
its
producer
,
Thames
Television
.

The
early
episodes
make
you
long
for
a
rerun
of
the
crash
of
1987
.

Let
's
make
that
1929
,
just
to
be
sure
.

According
to
the
program
's
publicity
prospectus
,
``
Capital
City
,
''
set
at
Shane
Longman
,
a
fictional
mid-sized
securities
firm
with
#
500
million
capital
,
``
follows
the
fortunes
of
a
close-knit
team
of
young
,
high-flying
dealers
,
hired
for
their
particular
blend
of
style
,
genius
and
energy
.

But
with
all
the
money
and
glamour
of
high
finance
come
the
relentless
pressures
to
do
well
;
pressure
to
pull
off
another
million
before
lunch
;
pressure
to
anticipate
the
market
by
a
fraction
of
a
second
...
''

You
need
n't
be
a
high-powered
securities
lawyer
to
realize
the
prospectus
is
guilty
of
less
than
full
disclosure
.

The
slickly
produced
series
has
been
criticized
by
London
's
financial
cognoscenti
as
inaccurate
in
detail
,
but
its
major
weakness
is
its
unrealistic
depiction
of
the
characters
'
professional
and
private
lives
.

Turned
loose
in
Shane
Longman
's
trading
room
,
the
yuppie
dealers
do
little
right
.

Judging
by
the
money
lost
and
mistakes
made
in
the
early
episodes
,
Shane
Longman
's
capital
should
be
just
about
exhausted
by
the
final
13th
week
.

In
the
opening
episode

we
learn
that
Michelle
,
a
junior
bond
trader
,
has
indeed
pulled
off
another
million
before
lunch
.

Trouble
is
,
she
has
lost
it
just
as
quickly
.

Rather
than
keep
the
loss

a
secret
from
the
outside
world
,
Michelle
blabs
about
it
to
a
sandwich
man
while
ordering
lunch
over
the
phone
.

Little
chance
that
Shane
Longman
is
going
to
recoup
today
.

Traders
spend
the
morning
frantically
selling
bonds
,
in
the
belief
that
the
U.S.
monthly
trade
figures
will
look
lousy
.

Ah
,
perfidious
Columbia
!

The
trade
figures
turn
out
well
,
and
all
those
recently
unloaded
bonds
spurt
in
price
.

So
much
for
anticipating
the
market
by
a
fraction
of
a
second
.

And
a
large
slice
of
the
first
episode
is
devoted
to
efforts
to
get
rid
of
some
nearly
worthless
Japanese
bonds
(
since
when
is
anything

Japanese
nearly
worthless
nowadays
?

)
.

Surprisingly
,
Shane
Longman
survives
the
week
,
only
to
have
a
senior
executive
innocently
bumble
his
way
into
becoming
the
target
of
a
criminal
insider
trading
investigation
.

Instead
of
closing
ranks
to
protect
the
firm
's
reputation
,
the
executive
's
internal
rivals
,
led
by
a
loutish
American
,
demand
his
resignation
.

The
plot
is
thwarted
when
the
firm
's
major
stockholder
,
kelp
farming
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
,
hurries
home
to
support
the
executive
.

But
the
investigation
continues
.

If
you
can
swallow
the
premise
that
the
rewards
for
such
ineptitude
are
six-figure
salaries
,
you
still
are
left
puzzled
,
because
few
of
the
yuppies
consume
very
conspicuously
.

In
fact
,
few
consume
much
of
anything
.

Two
share

a
house
almost
devoid
of
furniture
.

Michelle
lives
in
a
hotel
room
,
and
although
she
drives
a
canary-colored
Porsche
,
she

has
n't
time
to
clean
or
repair
it
;
the
beat-up
vehicle
can
be
started
only
with
a
huge
pair
of
pliers
because
the
ignition
key
has
broken
off
in
the
lock
.

And
it
takes
Declan
,
the
obligatory
ladies
'
man
of
the
cast
,
until
the
third
episode
to
get
past
first
base
with
any
of
his
prey
.

Perhaps
the
explanation
for
these
anomalies
is
that
class-conscious
Britain
is
n't
ready
to
come
to
terms
with
the
wealth
created
by
the
Thatcherian
free-enterprise
regime
.

After
all
,
this
is
n't
old
money
,
but
new
money
,
and
in
many
cases
,
young
money
.

This
attitude
is
clearly
illustrated
in
the
treatment
of
Max
,
the
trading
room
's
most
flamboyant
character
.

Yuppily
enough
,
he
lives
in
a
lavishly
furnished
converted
church
,
wears
designer
clothes
and
drives
an
antique
car
.

But
apparently
to
make
him
palatable
,
even
lovable
,
to
the
masses
,
the
script
inflates
pony-tailed
Max
into
an
eccentric
genius
,
master
of
11
Chinese
dialects
.

He
takes
his
wash
to
the
laundromat
,
where
he
meets
a
punky
French
girl

who
dupes
him
into
providing
a
home
for
her
pet
piranha
and
then
promptly
steals
his
car
and
dumps
it
in
Dieppe
.

In
producing
and
promoting
``
Capital
City
,
''
Thames
has
spent
about
as
much
as
Shane
Longman
loses
on
a
good
day
.

The
production
costs
are
a
not
inconsiderable
#
8
million
(
$
12.4
million
)
,
and
would
have
been
much
higher
had
not
the
cost
of
the
trading
floor
set
been
absorbed
in
the
budget
of
``
Dealers
,
''
an
earlier
made-for-TV
movie
.

Another

half
million
quid
went
for
a
volley
of
full-page
advertisements
in
six
major
British
newspapers
and
for
huge
posters
in
the
London
subway
.

These
expenses
create
a
special
incentive
for
``
Capital
City
's
''
producers
to
flog
it
,
or
a
Yank-oriented
version
of
it
,
in
America
.

Thames
's
U.S.
marketing
agent
,
Donald
Taffner
,
is
preparing
to
do
just
that
.

He
is
discreetly
hopeful
,
citing
three
U.S.
comedy
series
--
``
Three
's
Company
,
''
``
Too
Close
for
Comfort
''
and
``
Check
It
Out
''
--
that
had
British
antecedents
.

Perhaps
without
realizing
it
,
Mr.
Taffner
simultaneously
has
put
his
finger
on
the
problem
and
an
ideal
solution
:
``
Capital
City
''
should
have
been
a
comedy
,
a
worthy
sequel
to
the
screwball
British
``
Carry
On
''
movies
of
the
1960s
.

The
seeds
already
are
in
the
script
.

The
first
episode
concluded
with
a
marvelously
cute
scene
in
which

the
trading-room
crew
minded
a
baby
,
the
casualty
of
a
broken
marriage
at
the
firm
.

And
many
in
the
young
cast
bear
striking
resemblances
to
American
TV
and
movie
personalities
known
for
light
roles
.

Joanna
Kanska
looks
like
a
young
Zsa
Zsa
Gabor
;
William
Armstrong
,
who
plays
Max
,
could
pass
for
Hans
Conreid
,
and
Douglas
Hodge
(
Declan
)
for
James
Farentino
;
Rolf
Saxon
is
a
passable
Tommy
Noonan
and
Dorian
Healy
could
easily
double
for
Huntz
Hall
,
the
blank-faced
foil
of
the
Bowery
Boys
comedies
.

So
,
OK
kids
,
everybody
on
stage
for
``
Carry
On
Trading
''
:
The
cast
is
frantically
searching
the
office
for
misplaced
Japanese
bonds

that
suddenly
have
soared
in
value
because
Dai-Ichi
Kangyo
Bank
has
just
bought
the
White
House
.

The
pressure
is
too
much
for
Zsa
Zsa
,
who
slaps
a
security
guard
.

He
backflips
into
a
desktop
computer
terminal
,
which
explodes
,
covering
Huntz
Hall
's
face
with
microchips
.

And
all
the
while
,
the
bonds
are
in
the
baby
's
diaper
.

It
should
run
forever
.

Mr.
Rustin
is
senior
correspondent
in
the
Journal
's
London
bureau
.

REPLIGEN
Inc.
said
it
will
issue
one
million
new
common
shares
in
a
$
9
million
private
placement
to
institutional
investors
in
the
U.K
.

The
Cambridge
,
Mass.
,
biotechnology
company
said
proceeds
will
be
used
to
broaden
its
research
and
development
of
products
to
fight
infectious
diseases
and
to
increase
manufacturing
capabilities
.

Bear
Stearns
&
Co.
handled
the
closing
of
the
transactions
,
Repligen
said
.

After
the
sale
,
Repligen
will
have
about
8.3
million
shares
outstanding
.

Freeport-McMoRan
Inc.
said
a
temporary
cessation
of
operations
at
its
Sunshine
Bridge
uranium-recovery
facility
in
Donaldsonville
,
La.
,
will
result
in
slight
earnings
improvement
to
both

the
company
and
its
Freeport-McMoRan
Resource
Partners
Limited
Partnership
unit
.

The
company
did
n't
elaborate
.

The
diversified
energy
and
minerals
concern
said
that
a
depressed
uranium
market
is
responsible
for
the
temporary
mothballing
of
the
plant
,
but
that
the
plant
can
be
reactivated
quickly
when
the
market
improves
.

More
than
400,000
pounds
of
uranium

a
year
have
been
produced
at
the
facility
during
the
past
seven
years
.

A
second
uranium-recovery
plant
at
Uncle
Sam
,
La.
,
that
produces
more
than
700,000
pounds
of
uranium
annually
,
will
continue
to
operate
.

Freeport-McMoRan
said
the
shutdown
wo
n't
affect
sales
volumes
under
long-term
sales
contracts
of
its
Freeport
Uranium
Recovery
Co.
unit
,
but
will
reduce
the
amount
of
product
sold
on
the
spot
market
.

Freeport-McMoRan
Resource
Partners
,
as
owner
of
the
uranium-recovery
technology
,
receives
royalty
payments
.

FEDERAL
INDUSTRIES
Ltd.
said
it
agreed
with
underwiters
led
by
Scotia-McLeod
Inc.
to
issue
75
million
Canadian
dollars
(
$
63.8
million
)
principal
amount
of
9
%
convertible
subordinated
debentures
.

Federal
Industries
,
a
diversified
manufacturing
,
distribution
and
transportation
concern
based
in
Winnipeg
,
Manitoba
,
said
the
debentures
will
be
convertible
until
their
1999
maturity
into
the
company
's
Class

A
shares
at
C$
18.50

a
share
.

Federal
Industries
said
C$
54
million
of
the
proceeds
will
be
used
to
finance
its
previously
reported
plan
to
buy
W.H.
Smith
Canada
Ltd.
,
a
bookstore
chain
,
and
the
balance
to
repay
short-term
debt
.

It
was
n't
so
long
ago
that
a
radio
network
funded
by
the
U.S.
Congress
--
and
originally
by
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
--
was
accused
by
officials
here
of
employing
propagandists
,
imperialists
and
spies
.

Now
,
the
network
has
opened
a
news
bureau
in
the
Hungarian
capital
.

Employees
held
an
open
house
to
celebrate
and
even
hung
out
a
sign
:
``
Szabad
Europa
Radio
''
--
Radio
Free
Europe
.

``
I
think
this
is
a
victory
for
the
radio
,
''
says
Barnabas
de
Bueky
,
a
55-year-old
former
Hungarian
refugee

who
works
in
the
Munich
,
West
Germany
,
headquarters
as
deputy
director
of
the
Hungarian
service
.

In
fact
,
the
network
hopes
to
set
up
offices
in
Warsaw
and
anywhere
else
in
the
East
Bloc

that
will
have
it
.

But
the
rapid
changes
brought
on
by
glasnost
and
open
borders
are
altering
the
network
's
life
in
more
ways
than
one
.

In
fact
,
Radio
Free
Europe
is
in
danger
of
suffering
from
its
success
.

While
the
network
currently
can
operate
freely
in
Budapest
,
so
can
others
.

In
addition
,
competition
for
listeners
is
getting
tougher
in
many
ways
than
when
broadcasting
here
was
strictly
controlled
.

Instead
of
being
denounced
as
an
evil
agent
of
imperialism
,
Radio
Free
Europe
is
more
likely
to
draw
the
criticism
that
its
programs
are
too
tame
,
even
boring
.

``
They
have
a
lot
to
do
these
days
to
compete
with
Hungarian
radio
,
''
says
Andrew
Deak
,
a
computer-science
student
at
the
Technical
University
in
Budapest
.

``
The
Hungarian
{
radio
}
reporters
seem
better
informed
and
more
critical
about
about
what
's
going
on
here
.

''

Indeed
,
Hungary
is
in
the
midst
of
a
media
explosion
.

Boys
on
busy
street
corners
peddle
newspapers
of
every
political
stripe
.

Newsstands
are
packed
with
a
colorful
array
of
magazines
.

Radio
and
television
are
getting
livelier
and
bolder
.

The
British
Broadcasting
Corp.
and
the
U.S.
State
Department
's
Voice
of
America
broadcast
over
Hungarian
airwaves
,
though
only
a
few
hours

a
day

each
in
Hungarian
.

Australian
press
magnate
Rupert
Murdoch
has
bought
50
%
stakes
in
two
popular
and
gossipy
Hungarian
newspapers
,
while
Britain
's
Robert
Maxwell
has
let
it
be
known
here
that
he
is
thinking
about
similar
moves
.

But
Radio
Free
Europe
does
n't
plan
to
fade
away
.

With
its
mission
for
free
speech
and
the
capitalist
way
,
the
network
's
staff
says
it
still
has
plenty
to
do
--
in
Hungary
and
in
the
``
Great
Eastern
Beyond
.

''
Radio
Free
Europe
and
its
sister
station
for
the
Soviet
Union
,
Radio
Liberty
,
say
they
wo
n't
cut
back
their
more
than
19
hours
of
daily
broadcasts
.

They
are
still
an
important
source
of
news
for
60
million
listeners
in
23
exotic
tongues
:
from
Bulgarian
and
Belorussian
to
Kazakh
and
Kirghiz
.

The
establishment
of
its
first
bureau
in
Warsaw
Pact
territory
shows
the
depth
of
some
of
the
changes
in
Eastern
Europe
.

Months
before
the
decision
by
the
Hungarian
Communist
Party
to
rename
itself

Socialist
and
try
to
look
more
appealing
to
voters
,
the
country
's
rulers
were
trying
to
look
more
hospitable
.

It
proved
a
perfect
time
for
Radio
Free
Europe
to
ask
for
permission
to
set
up
office
.

Not
only
did
the
Hungarian
Ministry
of
Foreign
Affairs
approve
Radio
Free
Europe
's
new
location
,
but
the
Ministry
of
Telecommunications
did
something
even
more
amazing
:
``
They
found
us

four
phone
lines
in
central
Budapest
,
''
says
Geza
Szocs
,
a
Radio
Free
Europe
correspondent

who
helped
organize
the
Budapest
location
.

``
That
is
a
miracle
.

''

It
's
a
far
cry
from
the
previous
treatment
of
the
network
,
which
had
to
overcome
jamming
of
its
frequencies
and
intimidation
of
local
correspondents
(
who
filed
reports
to
the
network
by
phone
,
secret
messengers
or
letters
)
.

In
fact
,
some
of
the
network
's
Hungarian
listeners
say
they
owe
Radio
Free
Europe
loyalty
because
it
was
responsible
in
many
ways
for
keeping
hope
alive
through
what

one
writer
here
calls
the
``
Dark
Ages
of
the
20th
Century
.

''

``
During
the
past
four
years
,
many
of
us
have
sat
up
until
late
at
night
listening
to
our
radios
,
''
says
the
writer
.

``
There
were
some

very
brave
broadcasts
.

''

The
listeners
,
too
,
had
to
be
brave
.

Through
much
of
the
post-World
War
II
period
,
listening
to
Western
broadcasts
was
a
crime
in
Hungary
.

``
When
we
listen
to
the
Europe
station
,
my
mother
still
gets
nervous
,
''
says
a
Budapest
translator
.

``
She
wants
to
turn
down
the
volume
and
close
the
curtains
.

''

Now
,
the
toughest
competition
for
Radio
Free
Europe
comes
during
the
late-night
slot
.

Hungarian
radio
often
saves
its
most
politically
outspoken
broadcasts
for
around
midnight
.

Television
,
which
most
of
the
time
is
considered
rather
tame
,
has
entered
the
running
with
a
new
program
,
``
The
End
of
the
Day
,
''
which
comes
on
after
11
p.m
.

It
is
a
talk
show
with
opposition
leaders
and
political
experts

who
discuss
Hungary

's
domestic
problems
as
well
as
foreign
affairs
.

Those

who
want
to
hear
even
more
radical
views
have
to
get
up
at
five
on
Sunday
morning
for
``
Sunday
Journal
,
''
on
Hungarian
Radio
.

The
competitive
spirit
is
clearly
influencing
Radio
Free
Europe
,
which
is
trying
to
beef
up
programs
.

The
Budapest
office
plans
to
hire
free-lance
reporters
to
cover
the
latest
happenings
in
Hungarian
country
towns
from
Nagykanizsa
in
the
west
to
Nyiregyhaza
in
the
east
.

The
Hungarian
service
has
a
daily
40-minute
news
show
called
Newsreel
,
with
international
and
domestic
news
,
plus
a
daily
news
review
of
opinions
from
around
the
world
.

There
's
also
a
host
of
new
programs
,
trying
to
lighten
up
on
the
traditional
diet
of
politics
.

A
daily
35-minute
program
called
``
The
March
of
Time
''
tries
to
find
interesting
tidbits
of
lighthearted
news
and
gossip
from
around
the
world
.

There
's
a
program
for
women
and
a
science
show
.

And
to
attract
younger
listeners
,
Radio
Free
Europe
intersperses
the
latest
in
Western
rock
groups
.

The
Pet
Shop
Boys
are
big
this
year
in
Budapest
.

``
We
are
starving
for
all
the
news
,
''
says
Mr.
Deak
,
the
student
.

``
Every
moment

we
want
to
know
everything
about
the
world
.

Suzuki
Motor
Co.
's
U.S.
sales
arm
has
named
Gary
Anderson
its
top
U.S.
official
in
the
wake
of
a
series
of
resignations
last
month
.

Three
senior
executives
,
all
Americans
,
quit
in
September
.

Doug
Mazza
,
former
vice
president
and
general
manager
and
at
the
time

the
top
American
,
said
in
a
prepared
statement
that
his
and
the
other
resignations
were
prompted
by
``
changes
in
the
company
's
operating
goals
and
philosophies
.

''

Mr.
Anderson
,
who
joined
American
Suzuki
Motor
Corp.
in
June
1987
,
gets
the
title
of
marketing
director
for
the
company
's
automotive
division
.

He
inherits
``
bits
of
several
positions
,
''
said
a
Suzuki
spokeswoman
,
who
added
that
a
reorganization
last
month
has
eliminated
some
previous
posts
.

In
his
new
job
,
Mr.
Anderson
will
oversee
all
sales
,
advertising
and
dealer
development
activities
in
addition
to
formulating
marketing
strategies
.

Some
of
these
duties
had
been
handled
by
Mr.
Mazza
and
others
by
John
Dorsey
,
former
director
of
sales
,
and
Larry
Messelt
,
former
national
sales
manager
.

Messrs.
Dorsey
and
Messelt
were
the
other
two
executives

who
resigned
in
September
.

Suzuki
sales
so
far
this
year
,
at
24,405
cars
and
sport
utility
vehicles
,
are
less
than
half
the
level
of
a
year
ago
,
despite
the
introduction
of
two
additional
vehicles
,
including
Suzuki
's
first
U.S.
car
.

The
company
has
n't
recovered
from
claims
by
Consumer
Reports
magazine
that
its
Samurai
utility
vehicle
was
unsafe
,
even
though
the
National
Highway
Traffic
Safety
Administration
refused
to
open
a
safety
investigation
into
the
allegations
.

``
Suzuki
recognizes
its
responsibility
to
boost
dealer
confidence
and
improve
direct
communication
with
its
dealers
and
field
personnel
on
its
plans
and
strategies
,
''
said
Mr.
Anderson
in
a
prepared
statement
.

Mr.
Anderson
was
most
recently
Suzuki
's
New
York
regional
sales
manager
.

He
also
served
as
manager
of
dealer
development
.
